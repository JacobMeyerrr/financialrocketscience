    <h1>Sketch Comedy at USC: Reflections & My Biggest Takeaways</h1>
    <p class="meta">Dec 23, 2025 · Category: Comedy</p>
    
    <p>
      In today's post, I'd like to organize my notes and biggest takeaways 
      from a class I took at USC in Fall 2025, called THTR-470: Sketch Comedy 
      for Theatre. 
    </p>

    <p>
      But first, I'd like to give a quick intro on what led me 
      to take the course in the first place since honestly, I didn't even 
      know what sketch comedy was until this year (or whether it was worth 
      taking)!
    </p>

    <p>
      In Spring 2025, I took THTR-482: Standup Comedy 2 (Becoming a Pro)
      at USC. I'd exhausted the Standup curriculum and thought that I 
      was done taking official comedy classes at 'SC.
    </p>
      
    <p>
      Plus, with Standup 2 - with a high-level overview of most of the principles I 
      learned having been outlined in my first blog post about comedy - 
      I think that had developed a good comedic foundation and a system/process
      to improve which I could implement and become a good comedian with 
      going forward, with or without more formal instruction.
    </p>
      
    <p>
      In standup 2, I also had great classmates and we as a group had such a fun dynamic;
       I imagined that the dynamic would be hard to replicate
      and that, as a result, standup 2 was going to be the last time I ever took comedy at USC. 
    </p>
      
    <p>
      But long story short, near the end of the class, a couple of the other students 
      - Nick and Addy (both non-acting majors) - mentioned offhand that they were likely going to take another
      comedy class as an elective next semester, and it turned out to be THTR-470: Sketch Comedy. 
    </p>
      
    <p>
      So it was through this word-of-mouth that I heard about the class and ultimately 
      enrolled in it for the Fall Semester. 
    </p>

    <h2>*Disclaimer*</h2>

    <p>
      Many of the sketches - as comedy in general often does - 
      touch on relatively taboo or polarizing topics and issues. I'd like 
      to make it clear that with the examples shown here, 
      I'm not taking sides on any issue - I'm simply analyzing them 
      from a professional comedic perspective, with the goal being to help whomever 
      is reading this learn the ropes of comedy so they can apply it 
      to any topic. 
    </p>

    <p>
      All of the examples here are also all examples 
      we went over in THTR-470 - a formal sketch comedy 
      class at USC - so these aren't random sketches 
      but are rather ones that would be taught in a 
      full sketch comedy course or workshop. 
    </p>
      
    <h2>The First Day of Class</h2>
    
    <p>
      On the first day of class, in late August 2025, I walked in slightly late, 
      as would become customary for me on occasion since I had such a packed schedule with both 
      my Astronautical Engineering PhD work and since I was also a Teaching Assistant (TA) 
      for a class called ASTE-520: Spacecraft Systems Engineering (which paid for my 
      comedy and other classes' tuition), and since I also took another technical 
      elective course called CSCI-567: Intro to Neural Networks, in the same semester. 
    </p>
      
    <p>
      I also had a number of other extracurricular commitments outside of class 
      which kept me even more busy throughout the semester, but Sketch Comedy and
      becoming better comedically in general was a priority for me so I always made 
      sure to carve out the time for sketch comedy every week. 
    </p>
      
    <p>
      Class was from 12-2pm on Mondays and Wednesdays every week, in the 
      middle of the day.
    </p>
      
    <p>
      When I walked in, everyone was arranged in a circle, and I saw some 
      familar faces from my standup class in the spring, and a lot of new people 
      as well. 
    </p>
      
    <p>
      As I'd later find out, the class was approximately half SDA (USC School of 
      Dramatic Arts) Majors and roughly half non-majors like me. However, unlike me, 
      I quickly found out that virtually everyone else in the class was a comedic 
      genius, whether they were an acting major or not, and it defintiely challenged 
      me in a lot of ways throughout the semester but led to a lot of really good 
      comedy throughout as well. 
    </p>
      
    <p>
      USC is the number one, or at least close to the number one, acting school 
      in the world, so the people that were acting majors were the best of the best 
      and it showed throughout the semester. 
    </p>
      
    <p>
      As I talked about in my first blog post about comedy, and 
      will talk about in a subsequent section here, one of the 
      best ways to get better at comedy is to simply surround yourself 
      with a lot of other very funny people - ideally who are also 
      much smarter than you.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      For me, being 25 years old for the majority of the semester, 
      this was not only a rare opportunity to be in a sketch comedy class 
      with super talented people, but it was also an opportunity to do so 
      people who are also in the same ~18-25 age range as well.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Waiting until I was older to get started would've still been possible, 
      but in my mind, the conditions (both being around super talented people 
      and around people my age) likely wouldn't have been nearly as good and it 
      would've been hard to replicate the same dynamic. 
    </p>
    
    <p>
      In my mind, this opportunity was perishble so I definitely wanted to 
      take full advantage now instead of waiting until I was older (and busier etc. 
      than I already was). 
    </p>
    
    <p>
      The longer I waited, the larger the opportunity costs of reaping the rewards 
      of being good at sketch comedy and just from being funnier and more sociable 
      in general, so I dove right in despite being overwhelmed with all of my other 
      PhD and life pressures and responsibilities. 
    </p>
      
    <p>
      In the first class, we likely started off with introductions, possibly some theater games 
      (which are common in SDA/THTR classes) after, and then we dove right into writing
      with some prompts that the professor gave us to get right into the groove 
      of writing. 
    </p>
      
    <p>
      Throughout the class, the professor emphasized the importance of quantity, 
      exercising our writing "muscle," and just getting ideas on a page, consistently 
      day after day, week after week. She made this apparent on day one. 
    </p>
      
    <p>
      We came up with and shared our responses to the prompts in class, but then 
      we were told to brainstorm more responses outside of class as an assignment 
      and to bring those to the next lecture on Wednesday. 
    </p>
      
    <p>
      Other than writing more responses to those assigned prompts, our other 
      assignment was to read Chapter 1 of the book "The History of Sketch 
      Comedy" by Keegan Michael Key. 
    </p>
      
    <p>
      Without getting too much in the weeds, I'll start off with the 
      biggest takeaways from that chapter.
    </p>
    
    <h2>A Brief History of Sketch Comedy</h2>
    
    <p>
      The book started off by noting that sketch comedy has existed in its 
      current form - give or take - for approximately 100 years.
    </p>
      
    <p>
      But the chapter gives some historical context and background, tying 
      comedy back to ancient civilizations (the ancient greeks, romans, 
      sumerians). It also makes the argument that it ties into ancient and 
      primal aspects of human nature and our cognition, and that sketch (and 
      humor in general) is just a manifestation of that in a sense. 
    </p>
      
    <p>
      It also highlighted how the comedy of the aforementioned ancient 
      civilizations often centered around many of the common topics we 
      talk and joke about today, further showing how it's just a hard-wired
      part of our nature. 
    </p>
      
    <p>
      Moving forward to the more tactical content of the chapter, Keegan 
      Michael Key starts off with the definition of a sketch, which is a good
      place to start:
    </p>
      
    <h2>What is a Sketch?</h2>
    
    <p>
      According to Key & Peele:
    </p>

    <p>
        "A sketch is a short scene with characters, a premise, and some form of comedic escalation or heightening."
    </p>
      
    <p>
      And throughout the first chapter of their book, they 
      go into further detail on what that means and how sketches work
      at a basic level. 
    </p>
      
    <p>
      One of the most important concepts they highlighted after they 
      gave the above definition was the idea of the "you can't do that" moment.
    </p>
      
    <p>
      Key & Peele argue that the "you can't do that" moment - which is 
      when a sketch becomes funny because someone violates what feels
      socially or logically acceptable - is the main engine that drives most sketch comedy. 
    </p>
      
    <p>
      They also emphasized that the laughter comes from the sketch 
      (sometimes) being reletable to you, seeing human mistakes, and 
      watching someone (a character in the sketch) commit to doing 
      something absurd throughout the course of the sketch.
    </p>
      
    <h2>Benign Violation Theory</h2>
    
    <p>
      While Chapter 1 of Keegan Michael Key's book doesn't explicitly 
      touch on the "benign violation theory" of laughter, the above 
      summary certainly touches upon the same concepts, and I'll give a
      brief overview of the benign violation theory here. 
    </p>
    
    <p>
      To help visulize the concept, the Venn-Diagram for the benign violation theory is as follows:
    </p>

    <img src="HumorCode-VennDiagrams-BVT.jpg"
     alt="Learning curve"
     style="display:block; margin:1.5rem auto; width:400px; height:auto;">

    <p>
      Essentially, the Benigh Violation Theory is a theory 
      of humor that posits that something is funny if and 
      only if three conditions are met: 
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>the situation is a violation of norms</li>
      <li>the situation is simultaneously perceived as "benign"</li>
      <li>both of the above occur at the same time</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      In the class, the professor gave a more detailed definition that 
      a benign violation is essentially a violation of 
      something - whether it's a violation of a societal rule 
      or something you're not supposed to do - but that it has 
      to be a violation of a small and manageable one to the 
      point where the audience can see how the actors made that 
      jump, and how it relates to the audience and society today. 
    </p>

    <p>
      For example, the character can't just do something 
      that feels complely random or insane - the audience 
      has to understand why a character made that violation. 
    </p>

    <p>
      Whatever violation the character(s) commit has to make 
      sense based on the base reality the characters are in, 
      in addition to their specific motivations or point of 
      view. 
    </p>

    <p>
      Even if benign violation theory doesn't make sense 
      yet, I'll go through several good sketch examples 
      later in this post and analyze them using this 
      framework and other frameworks that I'll summarize 
      from the class in the sections that follow. 
    </p>

    <p>
      Long story short though, most things, in order to be 
      funny, according to this theory, have to be both benign 
      and a violation. 
    </p>

    <p>
      If something is benign but not a violation, it won't 
      get laughs since there's usually no tension, risk, 
      surprise, etc. 
    </p>

    <p>
      If you try and make a joke about something that 
      is too safe, familiar, or universally agreeable, 
      there’s nothing for the audience to react to. 
    </p>

    <p>
      But on the other hand, if it's not benign but is 
      instead a violation with potential 
      real-world repercussions or is something that's too cruel or hits 
      too close to home, or if it's in the territory where 
      the audience wonders "should I be laughing here?", then it's 
      almost certainly not funny. 
    </p>

    <p>
      Something I should note is that in my Standup 2 
      class, when we talked about boundaries with respect 
      to comedy, something that was said again and again 
      is that "Comedy = Tragedy + Time," and even in our 
      sketch class here, we talked about how whether something 
      is acceptable to joke about also relates on yours and 
      your audience's emotional distance to the situation 
      as well. 
    </p>

    <p>
     How close you and your audience are to the event in 
     both time and personal impact can have a tremendous 
     effect on whether something's ok to joke about, but 
     you should usually be safe rather than sorry if possible. 
    </p>

    <h2>Punch Up, Not Down</h2>

    <p>
      A good rule of thumb for sketch comedy 
      which was discussed throughout our class 
      was that you should "punch up (or across), but never
      punch down."
    </p>

    <p>
      While it's relatively self-explanatory, 
      punching up roughly means that you're 
      "attacking" or making jokes about a group 
      that's already in power or that has authority, 
      e.g. the government or famous creators. 
    </p>

    <p>
      Punching down usually implies that you're 
      making jokes about people who are less fortunate, 
      or don't have agency or power to do anything 
      about those unfortunate circumstances. 
    </p>

    <p>
      Either way, though, it will vary from person 
      to person or creator to creator depending on 
      their perspective and experience. 
    </p>

    <h2>"Embrace What Makes You a Loser"</h2>
    
    <p>
      After reading and discussing chapter 1 of the Keegan
      Michael Key book, one of the first videos we watched
      in class was the following video, which has a key takeaway
      for writing successful comedic characters:
    </p>
      
    <!-- Responsive YouTube embed -->
    <div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%;">
      <iframe
        src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FrGKqugNuU8"
        title="YouTube video player"
        frameborder="0"
        allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share"
        allowfullscreen
        style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;"
      ></iframe>
    </div>

    <p>
     While it's not relevant, our professor menioned that this was 
     a video of a fan cornering Michael at a conference or some type of 
     event, which explains why Key looks a bit nervous here, but that the response which Michael had to the guy's quesiton 
     was really good and had several key insights. 
    </p>
      
    <p>
      He emphasizes that on his shows, he often tries to create 
      characters who are trying to get away with something, because 
      comedy and drama has to almost always be about people behaving 
      badly, and that "if you write an uplifting scene, it's not funny."
    </p>
      
    <p>
      He emphasizes that it's often people trying to hide something, 
      get away with something, trying to think they're someone
      that they're not, and so on and so forth. If you can infuse that 
      type of energy in a character (they're a badass when they're 
      not really a badass, or they have more knowledge or wisdom than they 
      actually have), that's usually the cornerstone of great comedic character. 
    </p>
      
    <p>
      Boiling it down to a simpler and more classic example, Keegan 
      mentions that, as a famous SNL writer put it, "a really good comedic 
      character is often a character that embraces what makes them a loser." 
    </p>
      
    <p>
      So if you can find a good component about a character or something 
      they would care about that no one else cares about, and that they would 
      "go to the ends of the earth to fight for," that is the basic anatomy of 
      a good character.
    </p>
      
    <h2>What is a sketch? (alternate def'n)</h2>
      
    <p>
      In class, we also came up with an alternate definition of 
      a sketch, which is that "a sketch is a short comedic 
      exploration of a character, concept, or situation."
    </p>

    <p>
      It's important to note that a characteristic of 
      sketches is that they's short, usually only ~2-4 
      minutes (sometimes more) in length. 
    </p>

    <p>
      Later on in this blog post, I'll also highlight how 
      virtually almost all of the concepts that make up 
      the building blocks of sketches are also an 
      excellent framework for making good short-form 
      social media skit-style content as well. 
    </p>

    <p>
      For the majority of people reading this, they're either 
      looking for ways to become funner in their everyday lives, or they're 
      more likely looking to get better at social media content, rather 
      than become sketch comedians themselves. Or they also might just 
      watch late-night shows as a hobby and just want to be able to 
      appreciate, analyze, and understand these shows at a much deeper 
      level.
    </p>

    <p>
      Either way, understanding the principles outlined 
      in this document will help readers accomplish 
      all three of the above objectives. 
    </p>
      
    <h2>More Key & Peele Takeaways</h2>
    
    <p>
      Before moving on, there's a few quotes I'd like
      to highlight from Chapter 1 of the Keegan Michael
      Key book which I think are helpful. 
    </p>
    
    <p>
      One of the quotes touches on how laughter is so 
      deeply engrained in all of us, where Keegan says that 
      "even babies laugh before they can even speak... laughter 
      is the way humans of all ages connect and share..." 
    </p>
    
    <p>
      And also, importantly, that "the core of most humor comes 
      from us relating to each other and the awkwardness of 
      the human experience." 
    </p>
    
    <p> 
      In the following, longer quote, he paints a vivid picture 
      of the degree to which your humor should affect your viewer, 
      and what you should be shooting for when creating your 
      comedy pieces. 
    </p>
    
    <p>
      "It goes a little something like this... you know when 
      you're watching a sketch and one of the characters does 
      something really outrageous, something above and beyond, 
      that is so ridiculous that it's probably even wrong? I'm 
      talking about one of those moments that is so out of left 
      field, that it should be against the rules... like an ikea moment 
      when somebody might actually get yp out of their seat and talk back 
      to the screen. I've seen people during a comedy show that have to go 
      and leave a room because the joke surprised them so much... 
      that's the stuff I'm talking about..." 
    </p>
      
    <p>
      "Jordan Peele and I, on our show Key & Peele, were keenly 
      aware of this level of response, and like to see it as a 
      challenge when we wrote our material... how do we get someone 
      who is watching one of our sketches to get up and sat the 
      words our loud: 'No, no,.. this f-----, nope, you can't do that, 
      y'all stupid!'..."
    </p>
      
    <p>
      When writing your own sketch comedy or content in related formats 
      such as short-form video content, keep these concepts in mind! 
    </p>
      
    <p>
      It's a lot to digest, but these concepts are DEFINITELY 
      eye-opening! 
    </p>

    <h2>What Makes A Good Sketch Character</h2>

    <p>
      Characters - along with the right sketch structure - 
      are the bedrock of great sketch comedy.
    </p>

    <p>
      Sketch Comedy, by definition, is short, so the 
      characters must be both exaggerated and also very 
      focused so that the point can be made in the small 
      amount of time that they have during the sketch. 
    </p>

    <p>
      In fact, all of sketch comedy is an exaggeration of 
      the real world or real issues, but we'll talk about 
      sketch types in more detail in the next section. 
    </p>

    <h3>Point of View (POV)</h3>

    <p>
      First, for each character, you must start off 
      with finding their POV (Point of View). This is 
      generally the easiest way to create a comedic 
      character - and their POV essentially boils down 
      to "what do they care about the most?"
    </p>

    <p>
      Then, from the duration of the sketch, all of 
      their actions and responses stem from this one 
      primary POV and underlying motivation. 
    </p>

    <p>
      I'll give four quick examples of sketches 
      that we discussed in the class and the POV of 
      the main character from each sketch. 
    </p>

    <h3>Examples of POV</h3>

    <p>
      The first sketch is called "I Think You 
      Should Leave" with 
      Tim Robinson:
    </p>

    <!-- Responsive YouTube embed -->
    <div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%;">
      <iframe
        src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WLfAf8oHrMo"
        title="YouTube video player"
        frameborder="0"
        allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share"
        allowfullscreen
        style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;"
      ></iframe>
    </div>

    <p>
      The sketch is about a
      guy wearing a hot-dog costume who crashes 
      a hot-dog shaped car into a storefront, and 
      then becomes increasingly more unhinged while 
      trying to convince everyone that it couldn't 
      have been him (even though it's obvious 
      that it was!)
    </p>

    <p>
      In the sketch, Tim Robinson's Hot Dog 
      Man character's POV is that all he cares 
      about throughout the sketh is escaping blame. 
    </p>

    <p>
    The second example is called "Good Burger" and 
    it's about a fast food worker whose only motivation 
    is about giving customers a good experience, even 
    to the determent of the restaurant and his own 
    well-being: 
    </p>

    <!-- Responsive YouTube embed -->
    <div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%;">
      <iframe
        src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/g-wqQyqBsOk"
        title="YouTube video player"
        frameborder="0"
        allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share"
        allowfullscreen
        style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;"
      ></iframe>
    </div>

    <p>
      Lastly, the third example that we'll go over 
      here, which we went over in class, is an SNL 
      Sketch called "Target Lady."
    </p>

    <!-- Responsive YouTube embed -->
    <div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%;">
      <iframe
        src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-GyES-BNlUY"
        title="YouTube video player"
        frameborder="0"
        allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share"
        allowfullscreen
        style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;"
      ></iframe>
    </div>

    <p>
      In the sketch, the target worker's POV is that
      they care TOO MUCH about doing their job well, 
      to the point that normal customer interactions 
      escalate into abnormal and socially baffling 
      interactions. 
    </p>

    <p>
      Hopefully these quick examples help POV make 
      more sense as you go about developing your own 
      characters for your sketches. 
    </p>

    <p>
      For your main character(s), if you can't 
      answer the quesiton "what do they care (most)
      about?" (e.g. what is their POV), then 
      the character likely isn't fleshed out enough. 
    </p>

    <h3>One Overriding Want (Not Many)</h3>

    <p>
      When deciding your character's motivations 
      and POV, it's critical that you focus on one 
      overrriding want/POV/motivation. 
    </p>

    <p>
      This is because sketch is very short so 
      you much get to the point very fast. 
    </p>

    <p>
      All Sketches are an exaggeration, and it's 
      much easier when you're focusing on one thing 
      rather than too many. 
    </p>

    <p>
      Almost everything in the sketch should be 
      centered around the one want/POV that you pick.
    </p>

    <p>
      Just to drive home the point again, everything 
      in a sketch will stem from what the main 
      character(s) care about the most. 
    </p>

    <h3>Exaggeration, Grounded In Truth</h3>

    <p>
      As I've mentioned several times throughout 
      this blog post, all of sketch comedy is 
      an exaggeration, but the catch is that the 
      exaggeration must be based on something that's 
      at least grounded in reality or somewhat true. 
    </p>

    <p>
      For example, with the hot dog sketch above, 
      the "truth" (what's real in the sketch) is 
      that people often panic or are sometimes even in 
      denial, even when they're at fault, and that 
      they often deflect blame and sometime convince others 
      that they couldn't be responsible. 
    </p>

    <p>
      The sketch takes this to the extreme and 
      had the main character vehemently arguing
      that it wasn't his fault, even though there 
      were dozens of eyewitnesses and they  
      all concur that he clearly was the one who 
      crashed the car into the store. 
    </p>

    <p>
      In the Target Lady sketch, the truth is that 
      in the real world, retail employees are trained 
      to be overly polite and outgoing towards customers, 
      but this sketch exaggerates that to another level 
      to the point where the person become too obsessed 
      with doing those aspects of their job well, which then 
      led to the uncomfortable customer interactions 
      which made the sketch funny. 
     </p>

     <p>
      As a side note, tools like ChatGPT and other AI bots 
      are EXCELLENT at helping you break down these and other 
      aspects of skeches, especially as you're learning. I highly 
      recommend feeding them all of the fundamentals here and the 
      transcript (and any applicable secondary sources) 
      of the sketch you're analyzing, and if you're stuck on 
      figuring out "what is this character's POV?" or "what 
      is the ground truth (which is being exaggereted) here?" 
      or what the sketch type is or so on and so forth, it 
      can be an excellent tool to help you understand and 
      analyze sketches using the frameworks described here 
      once you're first starting out. 
     </p>

     <p>
      Once you get really good at sketch comedy analysis, you'll 
      start doing these things automatically as you start watching 
      sketches even just for fun. 
     </p>

    <h3>Specificity Is Key</h3>

    <p>
      Honestly, this is something that I myself still
      struggle with, even after having taken the class, 
      but this point - that specificity is KEY - was 
      repeatedly emphasized throughout the entire semester. 
    </p>

    <p>
      The comedy lies in the details, and the more specific
      you can get, the more believable the character's POV 
      and their exaggerated traits will be. 
    </p>

    <p>
      The core principle here is that "Generic = Boring" 
      and "Specific = Funny." Specificity is the tool which 
      is able to transform okay comedy into GREAT comedy. 
    </p>

    <p>
      Or if it's something that's simply relatable, but 
      still needs a comedic punch, details can turn that 
      thing into something that's actually funny. 
    </p>

    <p>
      Tying it back to the benign violation theory, 
      specificity brings things that were originally 
      too generic out of the "benign/boring" region 
      of the venn diagram.
    </p>

    <p>
      The better you are at specificity, as I'm 
      alluding to above, the funnier your material 
      will tend to be. 
    </p>

    <p>
      Particularly since sketch comedy is so short 
      and needs to get to the point FAST, the professor 
      repeatedly emphasized to always put more details 
      if we can! 
    </p>

    <p>
      Not only are specifics better for getting laughs, but 
      they're also really good for helping the viewer get 
      up to speed with the sketch, understand the base reality, 
      what it's about, what's going on, the who, what, when, 
      where, why, and how as quickly as possible. 
    </p>

    <p>
      We'll talk about all of those things in the sketch 
      types and sketch structure 
      sections, which are up next. 
    </p>

    <p>
      But before that - to help both myself and anyone reading this who might 
      also be struggling to understand and implement this 
      exact concept successfully - I'll go through a bunch 
      of examples to illustrate. 
    </p>

    <p>
      Some examples I wrote down that we had from class were:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Going from saying that a character smokes, → to  
      specifying what the character smokes (e.g. "they smoke 
      42 menthols a day..." or "they smoke 10 packs of 
      camel straights a day...") </li>
      <li>Going from saying "computer" in a sketch, → to saying 
      that the character uses a "chromebook" since that 
      detail will serve the comedy a lot better</li>
      <li>In a dental-related sketch, going from just 
      saying "tooth" → to saying "back molar" adds 
      more comedic specificity</li>
      <li>Going from saying character X went to
       "a restaurant" → to saying they went to a "Cracker Barrel location 
       in Utah"</li>
       <li>For a "nervous" character in a sketch, going 
       from no physicality → to introducing physicality 
       and expressing that nervousness through their 
       physicality. It made the dialogue and verbal jokes WAY better</li>
       <li>Introducing an accent or vocal inflections specific 
       to the character which bring them much more to life</li>
       <li>Dress and costume which are relevant to the character
       (even if highly exaggerated)</li>
       <li>Character-POV Specificity/Obsession (mentioned earleir)</li>
       <li>Going from a "doctor messing up during surgery"
       → to the doctor "dropped the appendix during surgery!"</li>
       <li>Going from a character who's "annoying" → to 
       "annoying and only cares about candy"</li>
       <li>Going from a "restaurant worker" → to 
       "a restaurant worker obsessed with customers'
       [having a positive customer] experience"</li>
       <li>Going from just being a "nervous character" 
       with nervous dialogue → to introducing physicality 
       like an awkard posture, fidgeting, movement, etc. 
       which really brings the character to life</li>
       <li>Going from being an "annoying kid" character → to
       "annoying person who sits with a specific posture" etc. </li>
       <li>Introducing specificity for a character through 
       a catch-phrase that they repeatedly go back to</li>
       <li>Giving your character the name "Target Lady" 
       or "Pool Boy" so that the audience understands 
       them and their role, POV, base reality, etc. more quickly and efficiently</li>
       <li>For a sketch about college life, going from 
       having the location be a generic "apartment" → to being a 
       dorm room (which introduces a different set of dynamics)</li>
       <li>Going from saying "my cousin" → to "my southern cousin"</li>
       <li>An overdressed investment banker character mentioning 
       that he wears only "Louis Vuitton Suits" and that it's 
       "$20,000 per piece." (costumes help A LOT as we'll discuss 
       in a later section)</li>
       <li>Going from saying "cookies" → to saying "double-stuffed oreos" instead</li>
       <li>Going from saying "car" → to "Ford Explorer" → to later saying "with sirens..." → then, later, handcuffs/warrant</li>
       <li>Going from saying job interview "at a movie theater" → to job interview "at a cinemark movie theater bar"</li>
       <li>Saying "Purdue University..." "The global one!"</li>
       <li>"Forty nine cigarettes a day"</li>
       <li>Smoking → "Smoking inside a Doctors office..."</li>
       <li>Going from "the summer I turned pretty" (TV show) → "the summer I turned slutty"</li>
       <li>Going from saying "starbucks" → to "Pasadena Starbucks"</li>
       <li>Starbucks Baristas saying that they "have three PhDs..."</li>
       <li>Specifying what said PhDs are in → "Astrophysics, Pyrotechnica, and small animal care..."</li>
       <li>From saying "Utah" → to saying "West Valley County, Utah"</li>
       <li>Going from saying "drug dealing" → to saying 
       "schedule 1 narcotics trafficking"</li>
       <li>Going from saying "dog" → to saying "Belgian Malinois"</li>
    </ul> 

    <p>
      This was a relatively short list of some examples that we had in our class that I wrote down or which were in the final scripts, 
      and there were so many more good ones which I didn't write down, but all in all, specificity 
      can range from just adding a little bit more detail to punch the script up all 
      the way to making it 10x funnier with specifics, depending on how creative 
      you're able to get with it. 
    </p>

    <p>
      As you can also see from the list, there's a lot more than just dialogue
      that goes into characters, such as dressing up, costumes, body language, 
      vocal inflections, and so many other aspects and specific details which you 
      can add and exaggerate - but we'll have an entire section on this later since 
      each of these things can have a huge effect on the effectiveness of 
      your sketches.  
    </p>

    <p>
      If you had to compress this section into one sentence, 
      it would be that "A Relatable Situation + a ton of ULTRA-Specific 
      Details (from a variety of vectors/angles) = Pretty Good Sketch Comedy."
    </p>

    <h2>Sketch Types</h2>

    <p>
      Most sketches aren't just ad-hoc or "random" - in fact, most follow 
      and fall into tried and true sketch "types" and I'll discuss some of 
      the most common ones and some examples of each below. 
    </p>

    <h3>Exaggeration Sketches</h3>

    <p>
      As I've mentioned multiple times, most sketches fall into this category, even if 
      they're primarily another sketch type, since most sketch comedy 
      is an exaggeration of reality or the concept you're talking about, to some degree. 
    </p>

    <p>
      It should be noted that sketches don't have to fall exclusively into 
      one "type" and that they can be a blend of multiple types. When a sketch 
      falls under multiple types, there are 
      some common combinations, as we'll see in our analysis 
      section later. 
    </p>

    <p>
      In exaggeration sketches, you take a real world situation or behavior 
      and push it far past norms, relentlessly escalating it to a point 
      where it's acceptable. Characters in the sketches here still believe 
      that they are acting reasonable even when the behavior becomes 
      extreme. 
    </p>

    <p>
      In short, in exaggeration sketches, you take 
      a recognizable situation and distore it via 
      exaggeration. 
    </p>

    <p>
      Examples we'll go over for this sketch type include:
    </p>

    <p>
      "Mr. Westerberg" from SNL (2015), which is a situation 
      where people are complaining about their boss, which is then 
      distorted via exaggeration: 
    </p>

      ></iframe>
    </div>

    <p>
      Another example of an exaggeration sketch which we highlighted 
      in class is "OK by Key & Peele" (Comedy Central), which is a 
      character-based exaggeration sketch, with the sketch being centered around 
      the thoughts that someone might go 
      through when they see *potential* signs of infidelity.
    </p>

    <!-- Responsive YouTube embed -->
    <div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%;">

        style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;"
      ></iframe>
    </div>

    <p>
      The next example, called "Simu & Bowen - SNL," and also discussed in class, is another 
      exaggeration sketch which exaggerates society's obsession with "firsts" and takes it 
      even further and to places that don't make sense.  
    </p>

    <!-- Responsive YouTube embed -->
    <div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%;">

        style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;"
      ></iframe>
    </div>

    <p>
      In class, we also discussed "Topper Sketches," which are 
      a sub-category of exaggeration sketches where characters 
      are trying to out-do each other. Simu & Bowen is also an example 
      of a Topper Sketch. 
    </p>

    <h3>Inappropriate Response Sketches</h3>

    <p>
      To create an Inappropriate Response sketch, you take a normal 
      or recognizable situation, think of what the logical response would be 
      (or have a logical response that would be clear to the viewer), then 
      have your character do the opposite OR something else that's illogical. 
    </p>

    <p>
      More often then not - as we'll see in the following examples 
      with Pete Davidson - it's an underwhelming reaction to the situation, but 
      sometimes you could go in the opposite direction and have it be an 
      over reaction as well. 
    </p>

    <p>
      The first example of this sketch type that we saw in class 
      was "Pool Boy" (SNL) with Pete Davidson:
    </p>

    <!-- Responsive YouTube embed -->
    <div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%;">
      <iframe

        frameborder="0"

        allowfullscreen
        style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;"
      ></iframe>
    </div>

    <p>
      The next example is also a Pete Davidson sketch called "Chad 
      on Mars" (SNL), featuring Elon Musk, where Pete's character 
      has extremely underwhelming reactions to the life and death situation he's going through and 
      the otherwise serious news he receives throughout. 
    </p>

      ></iframe>
    </div>

    <p>
      Another example - not discussed in class - 
      which I'd like to highlight, is called "Space Station 
      Broadcast," an SNL skit with Steve Carrell where 
      Carell, the "commander" of the international space station, 
      is broadcasting live and continues to do so nonchalantly, even as a series of increasingly 
      catastrophic disasters happen live on air.
    </p>

    <p>
      All three of the above sketches are examples of the "underwhelming reaction" 
      subtype of inappropriate response sketches. The following sketches 
      shown shown below are all "over-reaction" versions of inappropriate response 
      sketches.
    </p>


    <p>
      The first over-reaction subtype sketch is called "The White Rug |

    <p>
      In the sketch, one of the characters accidentally 
      spills a drink which stains a white rug, which is 
      understandably a stressful situation. 
    </p>

    <p>
      But the two homeowners completely overreact to the 
      situation, treating it like a catastrophe, escalating 
      it far beyond any reasonable reaction, which makes 
      it funny.

    <p>
      "The Telemarketer" by Key & Peele was the next in-class example:

    <p>
      Key's character in this sketch completely over-reacts 
      to being hung up on by the telemarketer once the telemarketer 
      realizes that he doesn't want to buy and it escalates 
      absurdly from there. 
    </p>

    <p>
      The final over-reaction sketch that we highlighted in 
      class was a sketch by a Canadian sketch comedy group called 
      "I don't drink:"

    <p>
      In this sketch, three of the friends order a drink 
      and the fourth says that they don't drink, and the 
      socially normal or acceptable response would be that 
      "that's fine" or "Cool! No worries," but instead, the 
      three drinkers have the opposite reaction and completely 
      over-react to the fourth friend not wanting to drink. 
    </p>

    <h3>Fish Out of Water Sketches</h3>

    <p>
      Fish Out of Water Sketches consist of a scenario
      where a character is placed in the "opposite" world 
      or surroundings that they're used to. 
    </p>

    <p>
      Typically, the humor comes from misunderstandings or 
      mistakes that arise as a result of this juxtaposition. 
    </p>

    <p>
      It's when a comic character with a unique 
      or "weird" POV is dropped in a normal world, where the normal 
      world is "weirded out" by the character.
    </p>

    <p>
      The opposite of a fish out of water sketch - where a 
      normal character (voice of reason) is dropped in a 
      comical/crazy world, surrounded by comic characters, is 
      called a "Center & Eccentrics" Sketch Type. These are 
      less common, but there's still a couple examples I'll 
      highlight here which we went over in class. 
    </p>

    <p>
      Something that's important to note is that it's easy 
      to confuse inappropriate response and fish out of water 
      sketches, although while you can sometimes combine the two, 
      there's usually some clear differences once you're able 
      to spot them. 
    </p>

    <p>
      In inappropriate response for example, most of the time 
      we have a recognizable situation - e.g. the space station 
      broadcast with astronauts in it - where the primary twist 
      is in how one or more of those characters don't react how 
      they are supposed to. Their behavior is the primary thing 
      that's off in these scenarios, not the fact that they don't 
      belong in that world. 
    </p>

    <p>
      Fish out of water sketches, on the other hand, are a totally 
      different type. Instead of having characters be in their own 
      normal worlds or situations, we either have a comic character 
      (who doesn't belong) in a normal world (for Center & Eccentrics), 
      where the world is weirded out; or a normal person in a comic/crazy 
      world (or the opposite of where they should be), and the normal person 
      is the one that's "weirded out."
    </p>

    <p>
      Before diving into examples to illustrate these concepts, 
      one last sketch type which isn't primarily a fish out of water subtype
      but it often combined with fish out of water sketches are 
      "two peas in a pod" sketches. 
    </p>

    <p>
      In this case, you would have two comedic characters in 
      a normal world (for a fish out of water sketch, or the 
      opposite for a C&E sketch), and this is very common and works 
      well because the two comedic characters can bounce off of 
      each other as they contrast with the voice of reason. 
    </p>

    <p>
      Let's dive into some examples - remember that fish out 
      of water sketches essentially are character-based, where 
      you come up with character ideas, then pair that character 
      with the opposite world. 
    </p>

    <p>
      The first fish out of water example we went over in class 
      is The Kroll Show's "Oh, Hello" on Comedy Central:
    </p>

    <!-- Responsive YouTube embed -->

        style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;"
      ></iframe>
    </div>

    <p>
      This is an example of both a two peas in a pod and a 
      fish out of water sketch. Here, the two comedic characters 
      are dropped in a world both where they play against 
      real-world athletes in a pickup basketball game and 
      talk to a normal doctor in a real-world medical setting. 
    </p>

    <p>
      In both cases, the settings are normal (pickup basketball, 
      medical appointment, etc.) but the two comedic characters 
      "weird out" the characters who are normally in those worlds. 
    </p>

    <p>
      In class, one of my favorite sketches we watched 
      and analyzed was "Pizza Business (SNL)" Starring 
      Jason Sudekis. 
    </p>

    <!-- Responsive YouTube embed -->
    <div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%;">
      <iframe

        style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;"
      ></iframe>
    </div>


    <p>
      In the sketch, the pizza lady is a fish out of water asking 
      for money for her absurd pizza business idea while the banker, 
      Jason Sudekis, and the setting (being in a bank) are normal 
      real-world settings. This is a classic fish out of water sketch.
    </p>

    <p>
      On a personal note, Jason came to co-teach one of my classes at 
      USC for a lecture - "The Game is Life" taught by legendary NFL 
      and College Football Head Coach Pete Carroll - so it's always fun 
      watching his comedy since I have that personal connection and 
      since he also dropped a lot of gold nuggets in that class regarding 
      how to get better at comedy in general and his own journey as a 
      "young 23 year old (expletive)" who was lost before he ultimately 
      found success later, which was also very relatable. 
    </p>

      The first picture shows our two professors, Dave 
      Belasco (of USC) and Pete Carroll, along with our 
      guest speaker, Sudekis. The second shows us as a class 
      watching selected Ted Lasso clips together. In the last 
      picture I'm in the LA Rams hoodie watching intently 
      along with the rest of our class!
    </p>

    <p>
      I'll write a more in-depth blog post or series 
      of posts about my experience in that class at a later 
      date, but the personal connection was cool, and 
      for now, let's get back to more fish out 
      of water examples!
    </p>

    <p>
      The next example, "I Think You Should Leave | 
      Hot Dog Car Sketch" by Netflix is a Joke (starring
      Tim Robinson), is actually one that we already 
      used as an example in the POV section.

    </div>

    <p>
      This sketch is another classic Fish Out Of Water 
      sketch since he's a comedic, non-serious, character 
      in a normal world treating a very serious situation 
      in a non-serious, joking way. 
    </p>

    <p>
      One more thing which I'd like to note about this 
      sketch which applies to all sketches is that they 
      REALLY layer in the comedy in this one in order to keep 
      the viewer hooked. 
    </p>

    <p>
      For example, in the second half of the scene, not
      only does Tim's character have his funny dialogue, 
      but he's both simultaneously layering in more layers 
      of comedy on top of that through both his costume 
      and his action (stealing clothes as he's making his 
      jokes as a "distraction"). We'll talk about "layering" 
      comedy in a dedicated section after sketch structure. 
    </p>

    <p>
      The next two examples - "SoulCycle (SNL)" and "Barbie
      Instagram (SNL)" are both examples of Center & Eccentrics
      (C&E) sketches, where normal characters are dropped in 
      a crazy world:
    </p>

    

    <!-- Responsive YouTube embed -->

      ></iframe>
    </div>

    <p>
      In SoulCycle, the two normal characters take a 
      class led by a bunch of eccentric people who are auditioning to be 
      Soul Cycle instructors, which makes for an awkward 
      but fun and comedic dynamic. 
    </p>

      ></iframe>
    </div>

    <p>
      In Barbie Instagram, the Mattel executives are the 
      normal characters, and the interns are the eccentrics, 
      with one of the interns in particular (Donald Glover's 
      character) stealing the show. 
    </p>

    <p>
      One of the top YouTube comments captures the 
      three eccentric characters perfectly: "Dumb, dumber and
      extremely dark, the three pillars of comedy."
    </p>

    <p>
      And not to go on a random personal side-tangent again, but 
      I attended the Barbie World Premiere in Los Angeles 
      in 2023, and it was a great movie and fun seeing the 
      actors in real life, so I have that personal connection 
      to this sketch, which was actually written a few years 
      before the movie came out. 
    </p>

    <h3>Inversion Sketches</h3>

    <p>
      Inversion sketches are characters or situations 
      behaving or occuring in the opposite way that 
      we'd expect. 
    </p>

    <p>
      This is a very easy and accessible form of comedy. 
      You can take virtually any character or situation and 
      apply this sketch type do it. 
    </p>

    <p>
      In order to implement this sketch type, simply 
      subvert expectations and do the opposite of what 
      we'd expect. 
    </p>

    <p>
      Usually Inversion sketches are more character driven. 
      Inversion sketches aren't always about their emotional 
      responses as much as it is about them simply behaving 
      the opposite of what you'd expect. 
    </p>

    <p>
      The first Inversion sketch example we went over 
      in class is called "Gang Orientation:"
    </p>

    <!-- Responsive YouTube embed -->
    <div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%;">
      <iframe
        src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NNx30-9dY1U"
        title="YouTube video player"
        frameborder="0"
        allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share"
        allowfullscreen
        style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;"
      ></iframe>
    </div>

    <p>
      In this case, while the situation is a "gang orientation,"
      the situation (and behavior of the characters) reads much 
      more like a corporate orientation than what you would 
      potentially expect with a gang, which inverts expectations 
      and makes it funny. 
    </p>

    <p>
      One of the other inversion sketches that we 
      watched and analyzed in class was "Sick Child"
      by Comedy Central:
    </p>

    <!-- Responsive YouTube embed -->
    <div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%;">
      <iframe
        src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tUj-65MxhEA"
        title="YouTube video player"
        frameborder="0"
        allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share"
        allowfullscreen
        style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;"
      ></iframe>
    </div>

    <p>
      The sketch is an inversion because in the sketch, 
      the sick child's dying wish is NOT to meet a particular 
      celebrity and the game of the sketch is essentially 
      the parents and kid saying all the reasons why they 
      don't want to meet said celebrity, which makes for an 
      aburd but comedic sketch on a usually very serious 
      situation. 
    </p>

    <p>
      The next inversion example from class, called "Girl at a Bar (SNL)"
      is a bit more straightforward: 
    </p>

    <!-- Responsive YouTube embed -->
    <div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%;">
      <iframe
        src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kTMow_7H47Q"
        title="YouTube video player"
        frameborder="0"
        allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share"
        allowfullscreen
        style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;"
      ></iframe>
    </div>

    <p>
      In this sketch, the woman waits at the bar - while 
      waiting for her other female friend to arrive - and 
      is initially apprehensive about bad (i.e. sleazy) men approaching her. 
    </p>

    <p>
      Instead, over and over throughout the sketch, she's 
      approached by men who are very politically progressive 
      (or at least pretend to be so) but who ultimately 
      end up being just a bad as the sleazy men. 
    </p>

    <p>
      Next up is "The Librarian" from Saturday Night Live 
      featuring Margot Robbie as the librarian character. 
    </p>

    <!-- Responsive YouTube embed -->
    <div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%;">
      <iframe
        src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IrMTLV2cR2Q"

        allowfullscreen
        style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;"
      ></iframe>
    </div>

    <p>
      The sketch has two clear inversions - where the
      behavior of the librarian character inverts and 
      clearly goes against expectations. 
    </p>

    <p>
      I've sort of seen this "double/layered inversion" pattern 
      come up with the last two sketches, actually. 
    </p>

    <p>
      The last Inversion Sketch example that I'll 
      highlight from the class is called "A 
      sociopath goes for a job interview" from 
      the british Tracey Ullman Show:
    </p>

    <!-- Responsive YouTube embed -->
    <div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%;">
      <iframe
        src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nTIfU4zMQWY"
        title="YouTube video player"
        frameborder="0"
        allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share"
        allowfullscreen
        style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;"
      ></iframe>
    </div>

    <p>
      In this sketch, a "sociopath" with a very dangerous 
      criminal record is being interviewed for a role at a bank, 
      and after initial pleasantries, the interviewers dive 
      into her criminal history throughout the rest of the sketch. 
    </p>

    <p>
      The tension understandably becomes high for the 
      viewer after that, especially as they dive deeper 
      into the details and specifics, but as the sketch goes on, 
      it becomes apparent that the interviewers are inverted 
      characters as well (not just the interviewee) since 
      they keep asking questions even though it was apparent 
      they should've stopped the interview early or never done 
      it in the first place.
    </p>

    <p>
      They also end up offering the person 
      the job at the end too, despite them "being on the run" for 
      "crimes against humanity" which completes the inversion. 
    </p>

    <h3>Clash of Context Sketches</h3>

    <p>
      Clash of Context sketch structure is essentially 
      a sketch type that generates the humor by combining 
      two worlds or situations that don't belong together 
      at all, with the humor coming from the juxtaposition 
      of those incongruous elements which do not logically 
      belong together. 
    </p>

    <p>
      The first clash of context example is the SNL classic 
      "Star Wars Undercover Boss (w/Kylo Ren):"

    </div>

    <p>
      In this sketch, the worlds of Star Wars (specifically 
      with a sith lord) and Undercover Boss are fundamentally 
      incompatible with each other (like, usually sith lords 
      in star wars don't have empathy!), but combining them opens up a lot 
      of opportunity for humor, and it was one of the greatest 
      SNL sketches of all time as a result. 
    </p>

    <p>
      The next clash of context example is another classic 
      SNL sketch called "Mafia Meeting" starring Pete Davidson 
      and Gwen Stefani: 
    </p>

      ></iframe>
    </div>

    <p>
      In this sketch, the clash of context is extremely clear 
      - a high-stakes mafia meeting is taking place but is then 
      interrupted by a singer's performance in the same venue. 
    </p>

    <p>
      That juxtaposition (life and death meeting with mobsters, 
      being interrupted by a care-free music performance) 
      makes for some really good comedy in this case. 
    </p>

    <p>
      The final clash of context example that I'll highlight 
      from the class is SNL's "HBO Mario Cart Trailer" starring 
      Pedro Pascal: 
    </p>

    <!-- Responsive YouTube embed -->
    <div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%;">
      <iframe
        src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UiIRlg4Xr5w"
        title="YouTube video player mafia"

        style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;"
      ></iframe>
    </div>

    <p>
      Here, the world of "The Last of Us" (which I haven't seen) 
      - a post-apocalyptic, serious movie - and Mario Cart (a 
      less serious, fun game) are combined, and imposing the 
      serious tone on Mario (and related characters) makes an 
      otherwise serious movie trailer very funny. 
    </p>

    <p>
      As of this writing, I don't have a full understanding of 
      clash of context sketches quite yet, especially since we 
      didn't go super in depth on these in class, but in future 
      articles (or revisions of this one), I'll dive deeper and 
      make the distinction between this sketch type and other types 
      clearer. 
    </p>

    <p>
      All-in-all though, clash of context sketches are 
      sketches where opposite or worlds that don't belong 
      together are combined. 
    </p>

    <h3>Parody Sketches</h3>

    <p>
      Parody sketchest are one of the most common types 
      of sketches and they essentially create comic effect 
      through imitation of some type of familiar or 
      well known source material, situation, or person. 
    </p>

    <p>
      Satire Sketches - which we'll touch upon in the next 
      section - are a sub-type of parody sketches, but the 
      main differentiator is that Parody sketches are just 
      for comic effect and don't necessarily need to 
      highlight societal issues like Satire sketches do. 
    </p>

    <p>
      Satire Sketches shine a light on society's ills or 
      societal issues whereas 
    </p>

    <p>
      In parody sketches, you're either making fun of something 
      because of distaste (e.g. because you don't like it) or 
      because you're making a playful tribute towards it (because 
      you do like it).
    </p>

    <p>
      The first in-class parody example which I'll highlight is one 
      that I also had as an example for clash-of-context, the Kylo
      Ren Star Wars Undercover Boss sketch: 
    </p>

   <!-- Responsive YouTube embed -->
    <div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%;">
      <iframe
        src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FaOSCASqLsE"
        title="YouTube video player kylo"
        frameborder="0"
        allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share"
        allowfullscreen
        style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;"
      ></iframe>
    </div>

    <p>
      In this case, it's parody, not satire since it's simply playfully 
      making fun of the star wars universe and undercover boss 
      TV show and doesn't dive into any heavy societal issues 
      or themes at all. 
    </p>

    <p>
      This Star Wars Undercover Boss sketch is also a type of 
      Parody called an "Anachronism Parody," which is a type 
      of parody that creates humor and satire by usually deliberately 
      placing something from one era into an incompatible 
      historical setting. This usually involves creating ridiculous 
      (but funny) situations through juxtaposition such as: 
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>A caveman using a smartphone</li>
      <li>A roman emporer dealing with modern office politics</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>
      The Mario Cart trailer sketch which we highlighted in the clash of 
      context sketches section also doubles as an anachronism parody. 
    </p>

    <p>
      The next Parody example is "Enhancement Drug" (SNL) featuring 
      Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson: 
    </p>

    <!-- Responsive YouTube embed -->
    <div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%;">
      <iframe
        src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5IZrYeUX3MI"
        title="YouTube video player kylo"

        allowfullscreen
        style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;"
      ></iframe>
    </div>

    <p>
      This sketch is a playful parody on enhancement drugs, touching on 
      and exaggerating themes commonly associated with these drugs, but 
      heightening them even further for comedic effect. 
    </p>

    <p>
      The third satire sketch I'll highlight from class here is a 
      parody of the bachelorette:
    </p>

    <!-- Responsive YouTube embed -->
    <div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%;">
      <iframe
        src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ploHR84-9UA"
        title="YouTube video player kylo"
        frameborder="0"
        allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share"
        allowfullscreen
        style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;"
      ></iframe>
    </div>

    <p>
      This one also isn't satire since it's simply playfully 
      making comedy out of the bachelor show format rather 
      than highlighting one of society's major ills. 
    </p>

    <p>
      The next parody example from class is an SNL sketch called 
      "The Black Lotus:"
    </p>

    <!-- Responsive YouTube embed -->
    <div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%;">

        allowfullscreen
        style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;"
      ></iframe>
    </div>

    <p>
      And the final Parody Sketch which I'll highlight 
      from class is caled "Swiftamine" from SNL: 
    </p>

    <!-- Responsive YouTube embed -->
    <div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%;">
      <iframe
        src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PAhAz7JU0dg"
        title="YouTube video player kylo"
        frameborder="0"
        allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share"
        allowfullscreen
        style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;"
      ></iframe>
    </div>

    <p>
      Swiftamine imitates and combines the familiar 
      format of a pharmeceautical commercial with a 
      well-known celebrity (Taylor Swift) and uses 
      those to parody, in a fun way, how widespread 
      Taylor Swift fandom has become. 
    </p>

    <p>
      All of the remaining sketch examples will 
      specifically be Satire Sketches: 
    </p>

    <p>
      The first Satire Sketch example is "Colorado" 
      by Amy Schumer (on Paramount+):
    </p>

    <!-- Responsive YouTube embed -->
    <div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%;">
      <iframe
        src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5UtXIhTRFLk"
        title="YouTube video player kylo"
        frameborder="0"
        allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share"
        allowfullscreen
        style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;"
      ></iframe>
    </div>

    <p> 
      The sketch uses a parody of a Colorado tourism 
      ad as the vehicle to touch on the much deeper societal 
      issue of reproductive rights and abortion, thus making 
      it a satire sketch since it touches on one of society's 
      ills. 
    </p>

    <p>
      The next satire example from class is "Alien Invasion"
      by Key & Peele: 
    </p>

    <!-- Responsive YouTube embed -->
    <div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%;">
      <iframe
        src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DWO1pkHgrBM"
        title="YouTube video player kylo"
        frameborder="0"
        allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share"
        allowfullscreen
        style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;"
      ></iframe>
    </div>

    <p>
      The sketch uses the alien invation parody as the 
      framework/vehicle to explore the deeper societal 
      issues of certain stereotypes, which makes the sketch 
      satire. 
    </p>

    <p>
      The last in-class satire example that I'll highlight 
      is Comedy Central's "ICE Responds to All That Negative 
      Press:""
    </p>

    <!-- Responsive YouTube embed -->
    <div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%;">
      <iframe
        src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jp_5WrJSb3A"
        title="YouTube video player kylo"
        frameborder="0"
        allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share"
        allowfullscreen
        style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;"
      ></iframe>
    </div>

    <p>
      This sketch, a Parody (and critique) of ICE's policies, 
      is satire since it talks about deep, real-world issues with the 
      U.S.'s immigration system.
    </p>

    <p>
      Now that we've gone through all of the major sketch 
      types and examples highlighted from class, I'll go over 
      the structure which applies to all sketches regardless 
      of sketch type. 
    </p>

    <h2>Sketch Structure</h2>

    <p>
      In our sketch comedy class at USC, we also 
      analyzed and constructed all sketches with 
      the same sketch structure.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Summarized succinctly, the elements
      of a sketch are the:
    </p>
    


    <ul>
      <li>Base Reality</li>
      <li>First Unusual Thing</li>
      <li>What is the Game (& each beat)</li>
      <li>Blow Beat</li>
      <li>Button</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Occasionally, sketches won't truly fit 
      in the set structure outlined above, but 
      for the most part, I'd reasonably estimate 
      that ~90-95%+ of mainstream successful 
      sketches follow this structure. 
    </p>

    <p>
      First, we'll start off with discussing the 
      foundation of all sketches - the base reality. 
    </p>

    <h3>Base Reality</h3>

    <p>
      The Base Reality should be obvious and crystal clear to the 
      audience as soon as possible. 
    </p>

    <p>
      By itself, it isn't explicitly meant to be 
      funny, but rather needs to establish the 
      who, what, where, when, and why of the 
      situation. 
    </p>

    <p>
      This should be introduced and given 
      enough time to settle before you dive 
      into the jokes and comedic material, 
      otherwise the audience could get confused. 
    </p>

    <h3>First Unusual Thing</h3>

    <p>
      The first unusual thing is the initial 
      element that breaks the established base 
      reality of the scene.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      The base reality itself 
      may be a bit absurd and get some laughs, but 
      the first unusual thing is the first abnormal 
      thing within that reality which starts "the game" 
      and the sequence of laughs that follow. 
    </p>

    <p>
      In other words, the first unusual thing 
      is when a character introduces an unexpected 
      or abnormal element that contrasts with the 
      everyday situation introduced in the base 
      reality.
    </p>

    <p>
      As I mentioned in the base reality section 
      above, usually the base reality has some time 
      to breathe before the first unusual thing 
      occurs - i.e. you don't just jump into the first unusual 
      thing or try and get jokes right off the bat.
    </p>

    <p>
      While there's always exceptions, if you try 
      to introduce it too soon, you'll likely leave 
      your audience confused. 
    </p>

    <h3>The Game (& "The Beats")</h3>

    <p>
      In sketch comedy and improv, "the game" is 
      the single, central, unusual pattern of behavior 
      or core comedic bit that the entire scene is 
      built on and continues to heighten to absurdity 
      throughout. 
    </p>

    <p>
      In sketch, in order to have the biggest possible comedic impact 
      on your audience and also not confuse them, you should 
      only have one "game" that continues to be played 
      throughout the sketch. 
    </p>

    <p>
      This is particularly important in sketch comedy (and other 
      related forms like short-form social media) since, by definition, 
      it is short (~2-4 mins on average, give or take) - unlike 
      longer-form comedy like sitcoms which are longer at ~21-22 
      minutes on average and have space for multiple games at once 
      (e.g. A/B/C plots, and subplots) or at least within the 
      same episode. 
    </p>

    <p>
      Each beat is typically an escalation of the same joke 
      format that was established by the first unusual thing. 
    </p>

    <h3>Blow Beat</h3>

    <p>
      Concisely put, the blow beat is the final beat 
      or joke where the game is taken to its furthest, 
      often most absurd/exaggerated level, after 
      which the sketch quickly ends. 
    </p>


    <h3>The Button</h3>

    <p>
      The Button is the final punchy line, action, joke, or 
      visual which provides a strong conclusive ending or 
      comedic twist for the scene. 
    </p>

    <p>
      Sometimes it makes a callback to an earlier part of the scene, 
     heightens the absurdity of the blow beat, or the game flipped 
     on its head - in an unexpected reversal - at the end. 
    </p>

    <p>
      The Button is always the last line or action of 
      the scene.
    </p>

    <h3>Two Quick Examples</h3>

    <p>
      Rather than trying to learn abstract definitions, 
      the best way to understand and internalize these 
      concepts is through good examples. 
    </p>

    <p>
      We'll start with two examples, with the first one being 
      a Comedy Central Key & Peele sketch called "Hall of 
      Mirrors" that we broke down in class: 
    </p>

    <!-- Responsive YouTube embed -->
    <div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%;">
      <iframe
        src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TCw-iEJoVfY"
        title="YouTube video player Hall of Mirrors"
        frameborder="0"
        allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share"
        allowfullscreen
        style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;"
      ></iframe>
    </div>

    <p>
      First, we noticed that the sketch type is a blend of 
      both parody and exaggeration sketch types. 
    </p>

    <p>
      It's a parody of a common, tense, situation in 
      detective and crime TV shows where a criminal is 
      always 1-2 steps ahead of the cop, and the subsequent 
      standoff that ensues. 
    </p>

    <p>
      Furthermore, the reactions are exaggerated for further 
      comedic effect. 
    </p>

    <p>
      Next, the base reality is as follows:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Who: Detective and Weirdo Serial Killer</li>
      <li>What are they doing: Standoff</li>
      <li>Where are they: Funhouse / Hall of Mirrors</li>
      <li>When is it: Nighttime</li>
      <li>Why are they there: For the standoff</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      The first unusual thing (for the base reality which 
      was established) was when Key pointed the gun at 
      Peele's character, along with Peele's reaction (the 
      movement he made) which was hilarious. 
    </p>

    <p>
      After this happens, the game is that Peele's character 
      is trying to convince Key's character that it's not the 
      real him - with the rough format of each beat being 
      Peele's character arguing "it's not the real me, I'm 
      just another reflection in a mirror..." and then Key 
      keeps pointing the gun at him as Peele's character comes 
      up with increasingly absurd reasons why he's a mirror 
      and not the real Peele. 
    </p>

    <p>
      The Blow Beat is when Key shoots Peele's character 
      in the leg, breaking the game and confirming he's 
      not a mirror. 
    </p>

    <p>
      In my class notes, I didn't write down what the button 
      of this sketch was - we likely didn't discuss it in class, 
      but the example below has a very strong button which 
      should make the concept more clear. 
    </p>

    <p>
      The next sketch from class which we'll break down the structure for is 
      one that I've shown a couple of times now - the classic
      SNL Star Wars Undercover Boss sketch with Kylo Ren:
    </p>

    <!-- Responsive YouTube embed -->
    <div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%;">
      <iframe

        style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;"
      ></iframe>
    </div>

    <p>
      The overall base reality is obvious: it's undercover boss 
      and the star wars universe combined.  
    </p>

    <p>
      Specifically, the who is Kylo Ren as the undercover boss 
      along with his empire officers and stormtroopers, the 
      where is "Starkiller Base" - some imperial base in the 
      Star Wars universe, the What is Undercover Boss, the 
      When is "a long time ago (in a galaxy far far away..),"
      and the Why is that they're there filming for undercover boss. 
    </p>

    <p>
      While the situation itself is unusual, the first unusual thing 
      that breaks the rules of the situation established by the base 
      reality is when Undercover Kylo asks the employees when they think of Kylo 
      Ren, gets oevrinvested, and has an extreme reaction to it. 
    </p>

    <p>
      The sketch continues this game of Kylo being such a bad boss 
      that even undercover he's not able to completely help himself 
      and he continues to take actions that "risk" exposing his 
      true identity. 
    </p>

    <p>
      The Blow Beat is Kylo using the force on the stormtrooper 
      in the galley and then throwing him against the soda machine 
      - thus breaking the game and clearly revealing who he was to 
      whom it wasn't obvious already. 
    </p>

    <p>
      The Button - which is a VERY GOOD EXAMPLE - is the dead 
      officer at the very end of the scene after Kylo essentially 
      saying he learned a lot, but in reality, this confirms that 
      he hasn't changed one bit through the experience.
    </p>

    <h3>Section Conclusion</h3>
    
    <p>
      This concludes the section on sketch structure. 
      Minus a couple of bonus sections with some additional 
      thoughts at the end, you're now fully equipped to 
      analyze and create sketch comedy. 
    </p>

    <p>
      This is certainly A LOT of material to digest, but as long 
      as you consistently practice everything I've taught here 
      over and over again and use the process for learning 
      comedy that I outlined in my December 20th, 2025 post, 
      you'll be able to analyze and produce good sketch comedy 
      (or just be funnier overall) in no time. 
    </p>

    <h2>Bonus Section: Costumes, Physicality, Inflection</h2>

    <p>
      While the fundamental aspects of sketch comedy which we 
      discussed above are important - character development, POV, 
      sketch type, sketch structure, etc. - one thing which I noticed 
      only from being in class and surrounded by classmates 
      who are world-class at comedy, was that there were A TON 
      of "little things" that, when added to sketches, make a 
      tremendous difference. 
    </p>

    <p>
      Don't get me wrong - the underlying principles taught above 
      are the foundation of good sketches or short-form comedy - 
      but what takes it to the next level is the actors' 
      total embodiment of the characters and scene through 
      things such as physicality, vocal inflections, pauses, 
      timing, pace, costume, props, sound effects, and more. 
    </p>

    <p>
      The positive impact of these details are only something 
      that I noticed in class, with all of them making a tremendous 
      difference once introduced to the sketch. 
    </p>

    <p>
      USC is the best or one of the top 3 acting schools in the 
      country, so all of my classmates who were SDA majors were 
      extremely talented and I picked up on these details over 
      the course of the class. 
    </p>

    <p>
      Introducing vocal inflections, and embodying the 
      character's emotions and physicality made in-person 
      sketches so much more engaging. 
    </p>

    <p>
      Something which might not apply to all but to some sketches 
      is that accents (New York Accent, or a British Accent, etc.)
      for particular characters made a tremendous difference for 
      certain sketches as well. 
    </p>

    <p>
      Timing and pace were things that the professor constantly 
      gave feedback on for nearly everyone as we practiced our 
      sketches throughout the semester. Sometimes, letting a joke 
      sink in and having that silence can be good, and there 
      was also an overall emphasis on pacing. 
    </p>

    <p>
      Costumes, props, and sound effects also made a tremendous 
      difference in our final sketches in particular. 
    </p>

    <p>
      Most of our sketches were practiced or rehearsed in class 
      with our normal street clothes and usually no props. 
    </p>

    <p>
      But the difference between the versions we performed in class 
      - which were still really good - and those same sketches in 
      the final show was tremendous. In the final show, we had costumes, 
      props, and sound effects, and all of these made the sketches 10x 
      better than they already were. 
    </p>

    <p>
      I'll do deeper dives on all of these "extras" in the future 
      since I'm still a bit of an amateur, but if you want to do your 
      own deep research in this area, here's some additional resources
      which might help. 
    </p>

    <p>
      In class for a Key & Peele Sketch called "East-West Bowl," the 
      professor mentioned that the "costume designer" for the sketch 
      was nominated for an emmy award. Researching the costume designer, 
      for example, could lead you to more resources that teach you about 
      creating good costumes for comedy, short form, or other similar 
      mediums. 
    </p>

    <p>
      Similarly, you could look up resources for sound effects 
      designers, read books on phsyicality, body language, and 
      emotion/vocal inflections, and more. 
    </p>

    <p>
      At the same time, watching a lot of good sketch and 
      short form examples and simply taking note might be the 
      most efficient way to get betetr at these things rather 
      than going too far down rabbit holes, but I'm just giving 
      some ideas since I'm not a huge expert in any of these yet. 
    </p>

    <p>
      For short-form content specifically, other things which 
      you might want to study from the most successful shorts channels and 
      most successful types of shorts in your niche, are a couple 
      dozen videos or more from a couple of dozen channels, and look at 
      not only how they write, but also: how they light, how they film, 
      how they do their set, how they perform, how many characters they use, 
      how they cut, how they edit, and so on. 
    </p>

    <p>
      This bonus section was a bit all over the place 
      since it's something which I'm still not super adept 
      at yet but know makes a big difference, so I wanted to 
      point these things out so you can do your own research 
      and incorporate them into your own sketches over time 
      to greatly enhance retention, quality, etc. 
    </p>

    <p>
      Here's some additional resources which the professor 
      pointed us to about hair/makeup/costume which might 
      be helpful:

    <h2>Bonus Section: Final Performance!</h2>


    <p>
      This article isn't officially endorsed by USC but is 
      simply my personal blog and recollection of my personal experiences 
      so I thought I'd include our class photo (from right after 
      our final performance) here! We seriously had the best group. 
    </p>

    <h2>Bonus Section: Full Sketch Analysis Examples</h2>

    <p>
      Once you have the proper frameworks in place - I 
      believe that learning from (good) examples - and doing 
      so with a large volume is the best way to truly 
      solidify concepts and do so quickly. 
    </p>

    <p>
      In other words, learning from (good) examples is 
      the best way to learn - as I've repeated multiple 
      times throughout this document. 
    </p>

    <p>
      So without further ado, let's finish this article 
      by analyzing several sketches and fully breaking them 
      down using the frameworks I summarized in this document. 
    </p>

    <p>
      Specifically, I'll be:
    </p>

    <ol>
      <li>Labelling the sketch type or types and WHY</li>
      <li>Giving a breakdown of the Sketch Structure - including the Base Reality, First Unusual Thing, What is the Game (and each beat), Blow Beat, and Button.</li>
      <li>Why I like the sketch in general and what draws me in as a viewer.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>
     This is a good way to analyze sketches 
     overall as you analyze them on your own time, in addition to 
     analyzing all of the other concepts I've summarized in 
     this document. 
    </p>

    <p>
      The first sketch I'll funny analyze is "Surprise Lady:
      Thanksgiving" (SNL):
    </p>

    <!-- Responsive YouTube embed -->
    <div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%;">
      <iframe
        src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/762p43qHRiE"
        title="YouTube video player"
        frameborder="0"
        allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share"
        allowfullscreen
        style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;"
      ></iframe>
    </div>

    <p>
      This is a classic example of a straight up 
      exaggeration sketch - where a recognizable 
      situation, character trait, or idea is taken 
      and amplified far beyond the lmits of reality 
      to an absurd, humorous extreme. 
    </p>

    <p>
      The base reality here is that a group of friends 
      and family are together for Thanksgiving Dinner. 
    </p>

    <p>
      The who/what/when/where/why of the sketch are:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Who: Family/Friends at Thanksgiving Dinner</li>
      <li>What: Planning to surprise the mom with her son unexpectedly returning from the military for Thanksgiving</li>
      <li>Where: Someone's house</li>
      <li>When: Thanksgiving evening, right before dinner</li>
      <li>Why: Paul unexpectedly got special holiday leave and they want to surprise his mom</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      The first unusual thing is sue's first over the top 
      reaction to hearing the surprise. This starts the game 
      which will continue throughout the sketch which is 
      Sue's complete inability to hold in a surprise being 
      further and further exaggerated throughout. 
    </p>

    <p>
      The Blow Beat is when Sue breaks the window and walks out, 
      which essentially ends the main part of the game. 
    </p>

    <p>
      The Button is Sue running back in and then grabbing 
      Aidy's hand and running back out the window after 
      hearing the news that Pete's character has a boyfriend. 
    </p>

    <p>
      This sketch overall is great since it is so physically 
      funny but is relatable, since we all know someone who can't 
      keep a secret for the life of them, and blowing that character 
      to the extremes will likely guarantee a laugh. 
    </p>

    <p>
      Next up is a sketch called "Bungee" (also from...
      you guessed it... SNL):
    </p>

    <!-- Responsive YouTube embed -->
    <div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%;">
      <iframe
        src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/66BCas_-ekI"
        title="YouTube video player"
        frameborder="0"
        allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share"
        allowfullscreen
        style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;"
      ></iframe>
    </div>

    <p>
      This is a classic example of a parody sketch 
      with an element of fish out of water (center 
      and eccentrics sketch specifically), since 
      the sketch is a parody since it makes fun of 
      some of the crazy varieties of workout classes 
      that have begun to emerge over the past decade.
    </p>

    <p>
      The base reality for this sketch is the Bounce 
      House Studio, a bungee cord workout class. 
    </p>

    <p>
     The first unusual thing is when Timothee's character 
     introduces himself and he treats the class like a drill 
     seargant, saying how hard it's gonna be. 
    </p>

    <p>
      The game is that the characters besides Michael 
      pretend that the class is hard when it's really not, 
      with everyone in reality simply doing easy bungee 
      cord moves throughout the class. And the characters keep pretending that 
      it's exhausting despite there being objective reasons that it's not hard 
      at all like the "calorie counter" on the wall. 
    </p>

    <p>
      The blow beat is when the characters eat cake and 
      then the calorie counter on the wall hits "-1128"
      which takes the absurity to a high level. 
    </p>

    <p>
      Overall, the sketch is relatable and hilarious since 
      (the perception at least is that) a lot of the new 
      trendy workout classes that have emerged over the past 
      decade don't seem to always include any form of real 
      exercise, and this sketch is a great, comedic example 
      highlighting that. 
    </p>

    <p>
      Next up is a CLASSIC sketch called "Substitute Teacher" 
      by Key & Peele: 
    </p>

    <!-- Responsive YouTube embed -->
    <div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%;">
      <iframe
        src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Dd7FixvoKBw"
        title="YouTube video player"
        frameborder="0"
        allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share"
        allowfullscreen
        style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;"
      ></iframe>
    </div>

    <p>
      This is a classic inversion sketch, since the substitute 
      teacher (Keegan Michael Key) doesn't act how you'd expect 
      normal substitute teachers to be. 
    </p>

    <p>
      The base reality is that Key's character is substituting 
      for a high school classroom. 
    </p>

    <p>
      The first unusual thing is that Key's character pronounces 
      a student's name from for the first time, saying "J Quellin" 
      instead of Jacqueline and the whole class becomes confused. 
    </p>

    <p>
      The game throughout the entire sketch is Key's character 
      says a name wrong, then freaks out when they correct him. 
      His reaction heightens even further after every single 
      student corrects him and he gets more angry and colorful 
      in his reactions. 
    </p>

    <p>
      The blow beat is right before he sends Aaron "A A ron" to the 
      principle's office when he is corrected by Aaron and then 
      starts flipping things over. 
    </p>

    <p>
      The button is when TimOthy just says "present" and 
      Key's character says "thank you" then the sketch ends. 
      In this case, the button was an unexpected reversal 
      of what the game was prior to this point. 
    </p>

    <p>
      In the future, I'll analyze and break down 
      a few dozen more sketches periodically primarily 
      using the frameworks taught in this class since 
      they're so powerful. This is primarily for me 
      personally to get better at sketch comedy AND 
      get better as a content creator and creatorpreneur, 
      more importantly, so that I can both reap the benefits 
      of being funnier in my everyday life and also make 
      a really good living from it in the not too distant 
      future, hopefully 
    </p>

    <p>
      As I've mentioned repeatedly throughout this article 
      and many of my blog articles, analyzing GOOD examples 
      (with the appropriate frameworks) is the best way to learn 
      - an ultra-efficient learning technique burned into my 
      brain from my USC Rocket Science PhD Days - so I hope that 
      the examples and analysis in this article helped!
    </p>

    <p>
      Whether you just want to become more of a comedy or sketch. 
      enthusiast, or whether you want to apply these techniques 
      and methods to something like short-form content creation, these 
      frameworks will serve you well and help you understand and 
      craft sketch comedy at a much higher level than before. 
    </p>

    <p>
      Again, I'm no expert on the topic - but that's probably exactly 
      the reason I'm one of the best people to introduce other amateurs
      to sketch comedy since I recently had to go through all of the 
      same hurdles myself that many other novices would as well. 
    </p>

    <p>
      I also primarily wanted to create this as a reference for myself 
      going forward. I am incredibly thankful for the opporutnity to take 
      Sketch Comedy at USC and I hope this article can help comedy overall
      have a substantially positive impact on the world.
