    <h1>From USC Students To Full Time Creators: Alan Chikin Chow and Cosette Rinab Social Media Talks</h1>
    <p class="meta">Jan 11, 2026 · Category: Social Media</p>

    <p>
      In March 2023, two USC Alumni who went on to become very successful full-time 
      content creators - Alan Chikin Chow (#1 YouTube Shorts Creator in the world, USC '19) and 
      Cosette Rinab (USC '21) - came back to USC to give their advice for anyone who wants 
      to be successful in social media. 
    </p>

    <p>
      I wrote notes for most creator talks that I went to at USC, but I never went back and 
      studied or organized my notes until now. From my time studying rocket science at USC 
      as well, I think that taking notes - and reviewing them - in the right way can make 
      a tremendous difference in what you get out of something (as opposed to passively 
      sitting through a lecture then expecting to remember everything for example - which 
      is almost always NEVER the case, ESPECIALLY in something as complicated as rocket 
      science - or even social media algorithms/strategy - lol). 
    </p>

    <p>
      I went through a similar process where I had a ton of class notes for my Astronautical 
      Engineering Master's degree classes that I had but never revisited until I had to take 
      my Astronautical Engineering PhD Screening Exam almost 3 years into my program. I had to 
      go back and re-learn everything from my classes from all of the notes, homeworks, exams, 
      and review/drill all of those materials until they became second nature to me. 
    </p>

    <p>
      I'm hoping that by going back and similarly reviewing/organizing my old notes from my 
      various social media talks that I've attended that I'll be able to do the same and make 
      a similar leap forward and breakthrough in my social media / entrepreneurial career 
      finally, and that anyone who reads this can gain similar benefit as well (if they read 
      all the way through all of these). 
    </p>

    <p>
      Without further ado, let's dive into the summaries, starting with Alan's talk. 
    </p>

    <h1>Alan Chikin Chow (100M Subscribers as of January 2026)</h1>

    <p>
      As of the writing of this article in early January 2026, nearly three 
      years after Alan Gave his talk, he is fast approaching 100 Million Subscribers 
      on YouTube (he's currently at 98.8 million on his "Alan's Universe" Channel).
    </p>

    <p>
      As of the talk in March 2023, I think that he had on the order of about 
      ~20-25 Million Subscribers (+/- ~5 Million) give or take, and he started his 
      channel in February 2020. 
    </p>

    <h2>Alan's Subscriber Growth Over Time</h2>

    <p>
      So his Subscriber Growth was pretty exponential - with Alan going from 0 to 100k 
      followers in 1.5 years, then 1 to 10 million in just over in the year after that, 
      and going from 10 to 20 million in 6 months. That comprised the first approximately 
      three years on YouTube, then in the nearly three years since, he's gone from 
      20 million subs to 100 million on YouTube alone. 
    </p>

    <h2>Intro On Alan</h2>

    <p>
      I ran into Alan in the hallway before he came in for his talk and he introduced himself. 
    </p>

    <p>
      We reminisced over his time at USC and how it let him to where he is now. 
    </p>

    <p>
      He was the head of community for the social media club that we were both in (with 
      him graduating before I started at USC) and he loved his time on E-Board for the club. 
    </p>

    <p>
      He joined the club in Spring 2018 (it was founded in Fall 2017, so he was the second 
      cohort), and he mentioned that he formed tight connections with everyone else on E-Board 
      and that they kept in touch after college and that they all became successful - which is 
      definitely inspiring to me (hopefully this turns out to be true for my cohort as well!). 
    </p>

    <h2>Alan's Mission Statement as a Creator</h2>

    <p>
      Alan has a really cool mission statement as a creator, which will also inspire my own 
      going forward, and it is (at least as of the time of his 2023 talk) as follows: 
    </p>

    <p>
      Alan is a "Creator with a mission to unite an audience of all backgrounds and identities 
      through laughter."
    </p>

    <p>
      That's a pretty cool mission statement! 
    </p>

    <h2>Alan is The NUMBER ONE YouTube Shorts Creator in The World</h2>

    <p>
      As of March 2023, Alan was the number ONE YouTube Shorts creator both in the 
      world and in the U.S. which is super cool, even surpassing Mr. Beast. 
    </p>

    <p>
      According to online sources, he is STILL the number one YouTube Shorts creator 
      as of January 2026, even OVER Mr. Beast, which is pretty amazing given Mr. 
      Beast's immense popularity. 
    </p>

    <p>
      If you add up both Alan's and Mr Beast's total lifetime views between both 
      longform and short-form videos, Alan's Universe has over 58 Billion Total 
      Lifetime Views since February 2020 as of January 2026, and Mr Beast's channel 
      has over 102 Billion Total Lifetime Views since he started his Main Channel 
      as of January 2026. 
    </p>

    <p>
      I'm not sure how to seperate analytics for short and long form videos, but 
      the fact that even if you include Mr Beast's longform videos, that Alan is 
      very close to Mr. Beast is pretty remarkable! 
    </p>

    <h2>Alan's Early Days</h2>

    <p>
      As mentioned, Alan was one of the first members of a social media club that 
      formed on campus in 2017, with him being a part of the second cohort in 2018. 
    </p>

    <p>
      Academically he was a Business Major with a Minor in Screenwriting. 
    </p>

    <p>
      He started making TikToks once he joined the club, with Markian Benhamou (the 
      founder of that club) and Mia Finney (one of the first members) being the 
      two people who taight him the ropes of content creation initially. 
    </p>

    <p>
      Back in 2018, no one was creating, so going viral was very easy. 
    </p>

    <p>
      Markian taught alan how to build a business around content creation, and 
      Alan even worked for him for a bit after graduating from USC in 2019. 
    </p>

    <p>
      There, Alan learned from Markian how to package content in ways that 
      you could monetize it. 
    </p>

    <h3>Learning How To Build Businesses Around Followers is an IMPORTANT Part of Every Creator's Journey</h3>

    <p>
      Alan emphasized that learning how to build businesses around followers is a very important part of 
      your journey. 
    </p>

    <p>
      You can leverage it into several different things, with examples that he gave being 
      deals for TV, Film, Podcasting, and even Late Night Appearances on shows like  Kimmel 
      or Fallon.
    </p>

    <p>
      I'm not sure why Fallon/Kimmel were brought up, but that was in my notes. He also 
      mentioned that most of the young people on these shows all come from social media now. 
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>As Side Note:</b> This wasn't discussed in the talk, but since I was curious, I looked 
      up WHY creators would want to appear on late-night TV. For traditional actors and 
      movie stars, it made sense since they were trying to adversite or promote their 
      movies. But For creators, while there could be several reasons, including promoting 
      some sort of project (especially if they're breaking into something more traditional), 
      the number one reason seems like it would be credentialing/legitimacy. If you become 
      big enough to make it onto bigtime late-night TV (with Steven Bartlett being a recent 
      example), then it legitimizes you which gives you a good amount of leverage. On the show's 
      end, bringing the creator on allows them to access new audiences - especially Gen Z - which 
      could help them expand their own audience and reach as well. Creators bring that built-in 
      distribution. 
    </p>

    <p>
      Succifce to say, you can leverage your following in a ton of different ways. 
    </p>

    <h2>What Makes a Viral Video?</h2>

    <p>
      Alan started off by explaining that he started making his first viral 
      videos when he was at USC by booking out rooms in our business building, 
      Fertita hall (and possibly other places on campus too). 
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>The Three Ingredients To a Vital Video/Short Are:</b>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Hook</li>
      <li>Retention</li>
      <li>Repeated Viewing</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Hook</h3>

    <p>
      Analyzing Alan's videos through this lens especially would probably 
      be a good way to study and get good at these very fast. 
    </p>

    <p>
      In the talk, we probably went over a video of his analyzing each of these 
      three facets, with him first going over the hook example as follows:
    </p>

    <p>
      In the example, the video was "would your boyfriend do this" (or something 
      like that), and his analysis of the hook was that the base reality of a 
      relationship is establishes, conflict happens, and an antagonist is established 
      as well. 
    </p>

    <h3>Retention</h3>

    <p>
      The hook, setup, and situation make you wonder what will happen to her, and see 
      the resultion of that situation, which gives him an almost 100% watch time on 
      these videos. 
    </p>

    <p>
      For retention, make sure you setup a situaiton that makes people want to see the 
      resolution at the end of the video. 
    </p>

    <h3>Repeated Viewership</h3>

    <p>
      He LOVES having a good joke as the ending for his videos. 
    </p>

    <p>
      Because, if there's a joke or a funny ending, they'll want to watch it again. 
    </p>

    <p>
      (As a side note, this joke at the end is called the blow beat - and/or button - in Sketch Comedy 
      and is something you see in nearly every traditional SNL sketch.)
    </p>

    <p>
      You want to end with something so funny or unexpected that it reframes the whole video.
    </p>

    <p>
      A great blow beat/button creates repeat viewing by making the audience 
      want to immediately rewatch the sketch/video with new context.
    </p>

    <p>
      You want to create a blow-beat/button that changes the viewer's perspective 
      of what they thought the "game" of the sketch/short was, which will prompt 
      them to want to rewatch it through a new perspective. 
    </p>

    <p>
      If you're interested in exploring this more, paste this section AND also my 
      entire sketch comedy article (with all of the examples) into ChatGPT and have 
      it help you analyze those examples to see why the blow-beat/button in those 
      would prompt someone to be a repeat viewer and why. You could probably do the 
      same for certain types of short-form content as well which are relevant to your 
      niche or format. 
    </p>

    <h2>What are his YouTube Demographics?</h2>

    <p>
      Alan's YouTube demographics breakdown says that ages 24-35 are his highest viewers, 
      BUT his hunch is that it's probably actually just kids using their parents' accounts. 
    </p>

    <p>
      Alan mentioned earlier in his talk that his content is primarily aimed towards 
      kids.
    </p>

    <p>
      He mentioned that YouTube is diverse - there's audience members of all different 
      backgrounds and identities, so you can make videos that cater to anyone. 
    </p>

    <h3>His U.S. vs International Viewership</h3>

    <p>
      The U.S. is by far his biggest audience, but he mentioned that he 
      has viewers from a lot of other countries too, particularly since many 
      of his shorts don't involve talking, which takes advantage of the "Khaby 
      Lame Effect" (removing the language barrier) which makes videos more 
      accessible to audiences around the world. 
    </p>

    <h2>Alan Shows Us How He Films (Live Example)</h2>

    <p>
      Next, Alan actually did an exercise where he filmed a video with us 
      and showed us how much effort goes into filming a video. 
    </p>

    <p>
      He said that many of his shorts involve quite a few shots, with many going 
      up to 70+ shots for maximum engagement.  
    </p>

    <p>
      While I don't remember exactly what the example video was about, I think that 
      it was likely about a student creating a disruption in a classroom (the talk was 
      in a classroom at USC, after all), with the teacher's increasingly exaggerated 
      interactions creating drama/comedy (with no dialogue). 
    </p>
