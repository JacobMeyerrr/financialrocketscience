    <h1>Steven He's Talk at USC: Reflections & My Biggest Takeaways</h1>
    <p class="meta">Jan 4th, 2026 · Category: Social Media, Comedy</p>

    <h2>Quick Intro</h2>
    
    <p>
      On November 17th, 2025, Steven He - a top sketch comedy creator 
      with over 28 million followers as of this writing - came to speak 
      at USC and give his advice on how to be successful at social media. 
    </p>

    <p>
      He gave a lot of unique insights - in particular, he gave a lot of great analogies 
      which I'll share in the sections ahead - that complately shifted my 
      paradigm for how I think of content creation, especially in the 
      business strategy sense. 
    </p>

    <p>   
      As of Spring 2026, I'm taking a break from USC and the PhD program 
      for the first time since starting in Fall 2021 to both focus more 
      on gaining actual professional work experience and the chance to 
      dedicate more time/resources to content creation again since the 
      PhD leaves me with little time, and little money in the free time 
      I do have to buy equipment, hire someone to film, edit, etc. 
    </p>

    <p>
      During my PhD, however, I still had the tremendous advantage of
      being able to meet some incredible people in the creator economy 
      since USC is located right at the heart of the creator 
      world in Los Angeles. 
    </p>

    <p>
      This is one of the things which made the pain and difficulty of
      doing a PhD particularly worth it, at least to this point. 
    </p>

    <p>
      But without further ado, let's dive into my 
      notes and biggest takeaways from the Steven He talk. 
    </p>

    <h2>Quick Intro on Steven</h2>

    <p>
      First, Steven gave us an intro on himself and his background. 
    </p>

    <p>
      He was talking to a relatively small room of ~20-25 content 
      creators and top marketers at USC. 
    </p>

    <p>
      He introduced himself as a Sketch Comedy Creator and that 
      currently he's the biggest sketch comedy youtube channel 
      on the planet! 
    </p>

    <p>
      (p.s. this was super cool for me in particular since I was 
      taking Sketch Comedy at USC that semester so this was sort 
      of a full circle moment connecting that with social media)
    </p>

    <p>
      He'd accumulated 28 Million followers as of the talk and 
      over 200 Million Views in the month of October 2025 alone. 
    </p>

    <p>
      He also mentioned something along the lines that "youtube is 
      all I think about" - which alludes to one of the biggest takeaways 
      which we'll get to later in this article. 
    </p>

    <p>
      After university, he set out to be an actor and did very well,
      but then 2020 (covid) hit and all auditions, classes, casting calls, and 
      so on all came completely to a halt. 
    </p>

    <p>
      As this was happening, he asked himself the question: "How do I 
      progress as an actor?"
    </p>

    <p>
      At the time, his thought was that if he could build and command 
      a massive following on social media, that casting directors would 
      be much more likely to hire him. 
    </p>

    <p>
      Since, for example, if he had three million active followers, then 
      theoretically, those would be something that he could then leverage 
      when getting an acting gig since he could say "hey, if you hire 
      me, I'll bring 3 million viewers to your show."
    </p>

    <p>
      As he became a creator and continued creating content, he studied
      his favorite channels and went in-depth on things like "how do they 
      write, how do they cut, how do they perform, how do they edit, and 
      so on" and he always made comedy sketches. 
    </p>

    <p>
      For him, he took the roughly first 200 comedy sketches to learn the 
      skills he didn't have, like how to expose a camera, or light a scene, 
      or how to edit, etc.
    </p>

    <p>
      Then at Sketch 220 - this was the first one that went viral and blew up. 
    </p>

    <p>
      He ran similar sketches for about 100 more time, then 
      he hit emotional damage - which is his long-standing series 
      that completely blew up his main channel to where it is today. 
    </p>

    <p>
      So early on, he primarily treated himself as a "classic video maker"
      where to get better, he'd make a video, then make another video, and 
      incrementally get better in between per the rough process above. 
    </p>

    <h2>Think Like a Traditional Business That Offers Traditional 
    Product Lines</h2>

    <p>
      After initially primarily thinking like a more traditional video 
      maker, Steven and his team transitioned into thinking much more 
      like a traditional business that offers traditional product lines. 
    </p>

    <p>
      He gave several processes and analogies which were very helpful. 
    </p>

    <p>
      With his process here, his process is that his team will:
      Study a demo that he sees potential in, Study the most 
      successful channels, and the most successufl types of videos 
      in that channel or niche (probably a couple dozen from a 
      couple dozen different channels), then study things like 
      how they write, how they film, how they light, how they do their 
      sets, how they perform, how many people they use, and all of the 
      elements as deep as they can go. Then they would craft their own 
      product for that market. 
    </p>

    <p>
      They'll then take ~100 tries (e.g. make 100 shorts), then take 
      feedback on every one of those (watchtime, comments, etc.) then 
      by short ~100 they're usually successful in any new market they 
      enter into with a new channel. 
    </p>

    <p>
      Then once that's continuously successful, they then build a team around 
      it to write, produce, shoot, edit, and post those videos at a certain 
      cadence. 
    </p>

    <p>
      Then once that's complete, Steven's job (with the way his company is 
      currently built), his job is to go build the next system. 
    </p>

    <p>
      For example, his current four systems - as of this writing - are 
      1) a shorts system which outputs 7-10 pieces of short form content 
      a week, 2) his flagship comedy sketch system, 3) a 30-minute episodic 
      improv show, and 4) his Steven He live channel. 
    </p>

    <p>
      Each of these has a full team behind it with the way his company 
      is currently set up. 
    </p>

    <h2>For Short-Form, Optimize For Instagram</h2>

    <p>
      They shifted their short-form strategy to optimize for instagram 
      and he significantly grew there this year - it's become one of their 
      biggest revenue drivers. 
    </p>

    <p>
      In his opinion, Instagram is the best place to get millions of views
      (as of the time of this talk in Nov 2025). 
    </p>

    <p>
      YouTube used to be king (and still is!) but surprisingly he's also 
      seen a lot of ad spend shift towards short form and they've 
      been able to take advantage of it. 
    </p>

    <h2>How to Think About Virality</h2>

    <p>
      During the Q&A, Steven was asked something along the lines of 
      "how did you decide what to do next after "emotional damage?"
    </p>

    <p>
      He then proceeded to talk about the common experience that many 
      creators have which is that we make 100 videos, then 1-2 of those 
      100 completely pop off. But then you have to continue making that 
      type of video over and over again (much to your chagrin) if you 
      want to continue performing well - even if it's not the type 
      of video you want to keep making going forward. 
    </p>

    <p>
      He made a good analogy with singers, which is that "as creative 
      people, by nature, we don't want to sing the same song for the 
      next 30 years..."
    </p>

    <h3>"Think of yourself as a regular business which sells a regular product"</h3>

    <p>
      So the most healthy and productive way to think about it - which 
      will get the most growth and revenue (things we want most out of 
      this career) - is to consider yourself a business, a regular business 
      that sells a regular product. 
    </p>

    <p>
      He gave a lot of GREAT analogies throughout the talk which illustrate this. 
    </p>

    <p>
      The first was to consider youself as being similar to a breakfast stand at a 
      farmer's market. If you make 100 different things that people DON'T like, then 
      your 101st thing - let's say it's a burrito - goes crazy and sells out and then 
      eveyrone says "I LOVE THIS BURRITO."
    </p>

    <p>
      The problem is that creators encounter a very similar phenomena where 
      they finally create their equivalent of the hit burrito, but then that 
      once they do strike that jackpot, their natural tendency is to say "let's 
      kill this burrito and sell a coffee... or something else" and then the 
      audience from yesterday that loved the burrito comes back and expects that 
      again, and you say "sorry, no burrito today - instead, we're selling 
      avocado toast!" 
    </p>

    <p>
      To map the analogy back to being a creator, many creators might 
      create 100 bad pieces of content, finally pop off, then their natural 
      tendency is often to NOT continue that thing since they're creative 
      people. 
    </p>

    <p>
      So the question is: how do we, as creators, deal with this? 
    </p>

    <p>
      The most productive way, he found, is to consider it to be 
      like servicing your audience. 
    </p>

    <p>
      So if one video blows up to a million views, assume a good number 
      of people loved that video, then consider that to be something 
      that you should keep serving to the audience until it hits its 
      natural waning in popularity. Consider that to be one "product"
      line - if we're going back to the real-world analogies. 
    </p>

    <p>
      Do try to innovate and add something new everytime, but keep 
      it a little more consistent. 
    </p>

    <p>
      You must deliver the SAME experience for long-form in particular 
      since with long-form, people intentionally clicked, but with short-form 
      there's a little more leeway since people usually don't just intentionally 
      click on your videos. You have a lot more freedom to try things which 
      don't work. 
    </p>  

    <h3>ChatGPT SUCKS at comedy... for now</h3>

    <p>
      As a random side-tangent, I wrote down in my notes that Steven mentioned 
      that ChatGPT isn't quite smart enough.. at least not yet. In another 
      2-3 years maybe it'll get to the point where it can get laughs, but it's 
      not quite there yet. 
    </p>

    <p>
      Whether it's 4 of them in a writers session, or him writing a sketch 
      himself, AI isn't there but he definitely thinks it will get there 
      eventually and thinks it will be a huge asset and boost to all 
      creators. 
    </p>

    <h3>How to Not Burnout Making The Same Video All The Time</h3>

    <p>
      Steven answered this from a few different angles. 
    </p>

    <p>
      The first - which I've already alluded to - is by changing 
      your perspective about yourself. 
    </p>

    <h4>"The Artist vs The Professional"</h4>

    <p>
      It took himself a while to learn but is an important one! 
    </p>

    <p>
      It's the artist versus the professional. 
    </p>

    <p>
      What's the difference?
    </p>

    <p>
      The artist expresses, and a professional delivers. 
    </p>

    <p>
      The difference is the direction. 
    </p>

    <p>
      The artist thinks "I want to make this story," "I think this is cool"
      "this is what I think is awesome..."
    </p>

    <p>
      Whereas a profesisonal thinks "how can I make this story for you", 
      "what can I produce for you."
    </p>

    <p>
      Sometimes the two will coincide, but Steven emphasized that 
      if for the majority of the time, if you think of yourself 
      as a professional in this sense (instead of an artist), you 
      will be happy to do your job. 
    </p>

    <h4>Context Helps A Lot</h4>

    <p>
      Meaning: he took a lot of time studying those he admired - 
      PewDiePie, MrBeast, all of the greatest comedy sketch creators 
      (Nathan Doan, Alan Chikin Chow, RDC World, CalebCity), etc.
    </p>

    <p>
      He studied all of their sketches - and one GLARINGLY obvious 
      fact is that it took ALL of these creators hundreds of tries too. 
    </p>

    <p>
      For example, it ook Mr Beast MANY years to get any views, so if 
      you're taking only 100, 200 videos to get any views, you're 
      doing pretty well relatively speaking! 
    </p>

    <h4>How To Pivot</h4>

    <p>
      Steven started off advice for pivoting by telling us 
      a cautionary tale where he mentioned how in either 
      2022 or 2023, he took some time off of his social media to instead 
      focus 100% on creating his own custom series which turned out to be 
      6 episodes and featured many of the biggest creators in the world. 
    </p>

    <p>
      In his opinion, it was a GREAT show, at least from his POV. 
    </p>

    <p>
      He invested $400,000 into the project, and it FLOPPED. 
    </p>

    <p>
      But not only did the series itself underperform, but since he 
      also posted it on his main channel, it tanked the performance 
      of all his other sketches on his channel by ~80-90%!
    </p>

    <p>
      But in the long run - as painful as this was in the short term - 
      he became a much better creator going forward after this experience. 
    </p>

    <h4>You Can't Pivot TOO HARD and Expect The Same Numbers</h4>

    <p>
      The lesson here is that you can't pivot TOO HARD and expect 
      the same numbers (at least for the same channel). 
    </p>

    <p>
      So going back to his cool analogies he made earlier, it was like
      he was Apple, and he had been making the iPhone before. 
    </p>

    <p>
      10 Million people a year lined up outside his door to buy the 
      iPhone, and he delivered it, and they were happy. 
    </p>

    <p>
      Then one year, he went "SURPRISE! HERE'S A TOASTER!" 
      and people stopped coming back as a result, largely 
      since they weren't being served what they were 
      expected and felt betrayed. 
    </p>

    <p>
      From then on, he came up with the following tactic that 
      top traditional tech companies have used: 
    </p>

    <h4>The 10% Pivot</h4>

    <p>
      What he means from this is instead of going from 3-minute 
      comedy sketches (what he made before) straight into making 
      a 12-minute TV show with different directing, different 
      writing, different cast, different cinemotography, different 
      everything, he'll only change like 10% at a time. 
    </p>

    <p>
      And since he's only changing 10% at a time, he'll test 10 
      different directions before he'll commit. 
    </p>

    <p>
      For example, he'll take a comedy sketch and MAYBE 
      add one more cast member, or make it 5 minutes instead 
      of 3 minutes, or another element of action like fight 
      choreography etc. - then whichever of these works, he'll 
      keep, and whichever flop, he'll not keep. 
    </p>

    <p>
      So instead of being Apple and pivoting from an iPhone 
      to a Toaster, this is the equivalent of now offering 
      an iPad, which is 99% of the same original experience. 
    </p>

    <h4>Don't Be Afraid To Take A LOT of Failues</h4>

    <p>
      Try like 10 directions of a 10% pivot, let 9 of them 
      fail, then double down on what does work. 
    </p>

    <h3>You Must Be Obsessed</h3>

    <p>
      Steven mentioned that you have to be all-in, that 
      it's a requirement. 
    </p>

    <p>
      As he went from an actor to a new content creator to 
      different tiers of content creation, then to where he is now, 
      and now he's met world class people from many different tiers 
      of life, he's seen one thing in common with all of them. 
    </p>

    <p>
      The observation is that the one trait that all world class 
      people have in common is obsession. He's NEVER met someone 
      who's reached that level who is not obsessed. 
    </p>

    <p>
      Kobe explained it best which is he told the story of his 
      youth and how be got into basketball, which is that initially, 
      he was an average kid, and didn't even score a point in an 
      entire season. 
    </p>

    <p>
      Then he started working more hours in the practice court 
      than everybody. 
    </p>

    <p>
      Then by the end of that first summer he was 200 hours ahead of 
      everyone else. 
    </p>

    <p>
      Then he continued doing this. 
    </p>

    <p>
      Then by year 2, 3, 4, he got thousands of hours ahead of everybody else. 
    </p>

    <p>
      By this point it would take SERIOUS dedicaiton for his peers to 
      reach his level. 
    </p>

    <p>
      Then in his pro game, he had 20,000-30,000 hours of practice ahead of everyone else. 
      By that point, no one could catch up to that 20-30,000 hours - it's virtually 
      impossible. 
    </p>

    <p>
      According to Steven, obsession is the only 100% accurate trait on this tier of professionals. 
    </p>

    <p>
      People who are THAT GOOD are usually at the point where they spend all day/night 
      thinking about it. They spend every waking moment thinking about it. 
    </p>

    <p>
      And because of all that work, they are SO FAR ahead of all their competition. 
    </p>

    <p>
      Social media is MUCH more competitive than ever. 
    </p>

    <p>
      You can't just start a youtube or tiktok channel like you could 6-10 years 
      ago and became successful without any work. 
    </p>

    <p>
      Instead, obsession will be the thing that differentiates you (and compounds 
      over time) from everyone else in today's competitive social media landscape. 
    </p>

    <h2>How To Not Burnout (In General)</h2>
    
    <p>
      "Burnout" regarding content creation is something that 
      many of the people in the audience had experienced, but 
      Steven had a very interesting take on this. 
    </p>

    <p>
      With content creation, Steven mentioned that he gets the REVERSE 
      of burnout - he gets itchy, like if it's Christmas and he is at home 
      not near a camera - he's drawn to doing it ALL the time. 
    </p>

    <p>
      He mentioned how he thinks about nothing but YouTube all the time (which 
      sort of harkens back to the last section). 
    </p>

    <p>
      BUT - this is another key insight here - he has burnt out in some 
      aspects and actions throughout his content creation journey. 
    </p>

    <p>
      Through the journey of content creation, there are many actions which 
      you WON'T like doing. For example - taxes, accounting, etc.
    </p>

    <p>
      BUT - this is an even bigger insight - he also emphasized how the 
      learning period of most skillsets (e.g. editing in DaVinci resolve) 
      and actions throughout will often burn you out. 
    </p>

    <p>
      HOWEVER - once you gain the skill, that burnout won't happen again. 
    </p>

    <h2>His Editing Software</h2>

    <p>
      He personally uses Da Vinci Resolve for editing, primarily because 
      it's both free and very good for editing in general. 
    </p>

    <h2>There Are Multiple Pathways To Becoming Successful</h2>

    <p>
      Steven mentioned that he might understand his niche for example - 
      e.g. engagemetn tactics, hooks, or that saturated colors in the back 
      help retention, etc. 
    </p>

    <p>
      But that some other people do it completely differently and throw everything he knows out the window
      (e.g. no writing, no shot change, no cuts, etc.) and still generate 
      millions of dollars on their content as well. 
    </p>

    <h2>All of The Biggest Channels Are Corporations</h2>

    <p>
      12 years ago or so, all the biggest channels were mainly just 
      people in their bedrooms makign videos.

    <p>
      More recently, it's been a shift of all creators moving towards entrepreneurialism. 
    </p>

    <p>
      The biggest ones in particular are essentially becoming corporations (using 
      entrepreneurialism to get there). 
    </p>

    <p>
      You CAN still just become a video creator, and make a living off of that - which 
      would be a great life to have - but to be a successful creator today, the goalposts 
      have shifted. You usually can't just turn on a camera and hit record in your 
      bedroom anymore. 
    </p>

    <p>
      So with Steven - at first, he was just a performer, then after 200 10% pivots, he 
      was a very good video maker, and that got him to about 10 Million Subscribers. 
    </p>

    <p>
      But to get to 100 Million Subscribers, he said he would have to obtain different 
      skills - the skillset of entrepreneurialism. 
    </p>

    <p>
      He gave another GREAT analogy to describe this. 
    </p>

    <p>
      Think of going from 0 to 10 Million followers as being similar to being a mountain 
      climber who wants to climb Mount Everest. 
    </p>

    <p>
      You have to gain the skillsets you need in order to climb Everest and get really 
      good at them. 
    </p>

    <p>
      But if you want to climb to the Moon, the same skillsets will NOT get you there! 
    </p>

    <p>
      You can even be the GREATEST at climbing Mount Everest, but in no way will 
      that skillset be useful in getting you to the moon. 
    </p>

    <p>
      In order to get to the moon, you have to learn a different skillset - how to build 
      a rocket, and how to manage all of that stuff. 
    </p>

    <p>
      THIS is the reason why all big creators have shifted to entrepreneurialism - if 
      their goal is to maximize success in income and impact, at least.
