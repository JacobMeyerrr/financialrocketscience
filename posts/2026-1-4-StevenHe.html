    <h1>Steven He's Talk at USC: Reflections & My Biggest Takeaways</h1>
    <p class="meta">Jan 4th, 2026 · Category: Social Media, Comedy</p>

    <h2>Quick Intro</h2>
    
    <p>
      On November 17th, 2025, Steven He - a top sketch comedy creator 
      with over 28 million followers as of this writing - came to speak 
      at USC and give his advice on how to be successful at social media. 
    </p>

    <p>
      He gave a lot of unique insights - in particular, he gave a lot of great analogies 
      which I'll share in the sections ahead - that complately shifted my 
      paradigm for how I think of content creation, especially in the 
      business strategy sense. 
    </p>

    <p>   
      As of Spring 2026, I'm taking a break from USC and the PhD program 
      for the first time since starting in Fall 2021 to both focus more 
      on gaining actual professional work experience and the chance to 
      dedicate more time/resources to content creation again since the 
      PhD leaves me with little time, and little money in the free time 
      I do have to buy equipment, hire someone to film, edit, etc. 
    </p>

    <p>
      During my PhD, however, I still had the tremendous advantage of
      being able to meet some incredible people in the creator economy 
      since USC is located right at the heart of the creator 
      world in Los Angeles. 
    </p>

    <p>
      This is one of the things which made the pain and difficulty of
      doing a PhD particularly worth it, at least to this point. 
    </p>

    <p>
      But without further ado, let's dive into my 
      notes and biggest takeaways from the Steven He talk. 
    </p>

    <h2>Quick Intro on Steven</h2>

    <p>
      First, Steven gave us an intro on himself and his background. 
    </p>

    <p>
      He was talking to a relatively small room of ~20-25 content 
      creators and top marketers at USC. 
    </p>

    <p>
      He introduced himself as a Sketch Comedy Creator and that 
      currently he's the biggest sketch comedy youtube channel 
      on the planet! 
    </p>

    <p>
      (p.s. this was super cool for me in particular since I was 
      taking Sketch Comedy at USC that semester so this was sort 
      of a full circle moment connecting that with social media)
    </p>

    <p>
      He'd accumulated 28 Million followers as of the talk and 
      over 200 Million Views in the month of October 2025 alone. 
    </p>

    <p>
      He also mentioned something along the lines that "youtube is 
      all I think about" - which alludes to one of the biggest takeaways 
      which we'll get to later in this article. 
    </p>

    <p>
      After university, he set out to be an actor and did very well,
      but then 2020 (covid) hit and all auditions, classes, casting calls, and 
      so on all came completely to a halt. 
    </p>

    <p>
      As this was happening, he asked himself the question: "How do I 
      progress as an actor?"
    </p>

    <p>
      At the time, his thought was that if he could build and command 
      a massive following on social media, that casting directors would 
      be much more likely to hire him. 
    </p>

    <p>
      Since, for example, if he had three million active followers, then 
      theoretically, those would be something that he could then leverage 
      when getting an acting gig since he could say "hey, if you hire 
      me, I'll bring 3 million viewers to your show."
    </p>

    <p>
      As he became a creator and continued creating content, he studied
      his favorite channels and went in-depth on things like "how do they 
      write, how do they cut, how do they perform, how do they edit, and 
      so on" and he always made comedy sketches. 
    </p>

    <h3>His Optimization Process</h3>

    <p>
      For him, he took the roughly first 200 comedy sketches to learn the 
      skills he didn't have, like how to expose a camera, or light a scene, 
      or how to edit, etc.
    </p>

    <p>
      Then at Sketch 220 - this was the first one that went viral and blew up. 
    </p>

    <p>
      He ran similar sketches for about 100 more time, then 
      he hit emotional damage - which is his long-standing series 
      that completely blew up his main channel to where it is today. 
    </p>

    <p>
      So early on, he primarily treated himself as a "classic video maker"
      where to get better, he'd make a video, then make another video, and 
      incrementally get better in between per the rough process above. 
    </p>

    <h2>Think Like a Traditional Business That Offers Traditional 
    Product Lines</h2>

    <p>
      After initially primarily thinking like a more traditional video 
      maker, Steven and his team transitioned into thinking much more 
      like a traditional business that offers traditional product lines. 
    </p>

    <p>
      He gave several processes and analogies which were very helpful. 
    </p>

    <p>
      With his process here, his process is that his team will:
      Study a demo that he sees potential in, Study the most 
      successful channels, and the most successufl types of videos 
      in that channel or niche (probably a couple dozen from a 
      couple dozen different channels), then study things like 
      how they write, how they film, how they light, how they do their 
      sets, how they perform, how many people they use, and all of the 
      elements as deep as they can go. Then they would craft their own 
      product for that market. 
    </p>

    <p>
      They'll then take ~100 tries (e.g. make 100 shorts), then take 
      feedback on every one of those (watchtime, comments, etc.) then 
      by short ~100 they're usually successful in any new market they 
      enter into with a new channel. 
    </p>

    <p>
      Then once that's continuously successful, they then build a team around 
      it to write, produce, shoot, edit, and post those videos at a certain 
      cadence. 
    </p>

    <p>
      Then once that's complete, Steven's job (with the way his company is 
      currently built), his job is to go build the next system. 
    </p>

    <p>
      For example, his current four systems - as of this writing - are 
      1) a shorts system which outputs 7-10 pieces of short form content 
      a week, 2) his flagship comedy sketch system, 3) a 30-minute episodic 
      improv show, and 4) his Steven He live channel. 
    </p>

    <p>
      Each of these has a full team behind it with the way his company 
      is currently set up. 
    </p>

    <h2>For Short-Form, Optimize For Instagram</h2>

    <p>
      They shifted their short-form strategy to optimize for instagram 
      and he significantly grew there this year - it's become one of their 
      biggest revenue drivers. 
    </p>

    <p>
      In his opinion, Instagram is the best place to get millions of views
      (as of the time of this talk in Nov 2025). 
    </p>

    <p>
      YouTube used to be king (and still is!) but surprisingly he's also 
      seen a lot of ad spend shift towards short form and they've 
      been able to take advantage of it. 
    </p>

    <h2>How to Think About Virality</h2>

    <p>
      During the Q&A, Steven was asked something along the lines of 
      "how did you decide what to do next after "emotional damage?"
    </p>

    <p>
      He then proceeded to talk about the common experience that many 
      creators have which is that we make 100 videos, then 1-2 of those 
      100 completely pop off. But then you have to continue making that 
      type of video over and over again (much to your chagrin) if you 
      want to continue performing well - even if it's not the type 
      of video you want to keep making going forward. 
    </p>

    <p>
      He made a good analogy with singers, which is that "as creative 
      people, by nature, we don't want to sing the same song for the 
      next 30 years..."
    </p>

    <h3>"Think of yourself as a regular business which sells a regular product"</h3>

    <p>
      So the most healthy and productive way to think about it - which 
      will get the most growth and revenue (things we want most out of 
      this career) - is to consider yourself a business, a regular business 
      that sells a regular product. 
    </p>

    <p>
      He gave a lot of GREAT analogies throughout the talk which illustrate this. 
    </p>

    <p>
      The first was to consider youself as being similar to a breakfast stand at a 
      farmer's market. If you make 100 different things that people DON'T like, then 
      your 101st thing - let's say it's a burrito - goes crazy and sells out and then 
      eveyrone says "I LOVE THIS BURRITO."
    </p>

    <p>
      The problem is that creators encounter a very similar phenomena where 
      they finally create their equivalent of the hit burrito, but then that 
      once they do strike that jackpot, their natural tendency is to say "let's 
      kill this burrito and sell a coffee... or something else" and then the 
      audience from yesterday that loved the burrito comes back and expects that 
      again, and you say "sorry, no burrito today - instead, we're selling 
      avocado toast!" 
    </p>

    <p>
      To map the analogy back to being a creator, many creators might 
      create 100 bad pieces of content, finally pop off, then their natural 
      tendency is often to NOT continue that thing since they're creative 
      people. 
    </p>

    <p>
      So the question is: how do we, as creators, deal with this? 
    </p>

    <p>
      The most productive way, he found, is to consider it to be 
      like servicing your audience. 
    </p>

    <p>
      So if one video blows up to a million views, assume a good number 
      of people loved that video, then consider that to be something 
      that you should keep serving to the audience until it hits its 
      natural waning in popularity. Consider that to be one "product"
      line - if we're going back to the real-world analogies. 
    </p>

    <p>
      Do try to innovate and add something new everytime, but keep 
      it a little more consistent. 
    </p>

    <p>
      You must deliver the SAME experience for long-form in particular 
      since with long-form, people intentionally clicked, but with short-form 
      there's a little more leeway since people usually don't just intentionally 
      click on your videos. You have a lot more freedom to try things which 
      don't work. 
    </p>  

    <h3>ChatGPT SUCKS at comedy... for now</h3>

    <p>
      As a random side-tangent, I wrote down in my notes that Steven mentioned 
      that ChatGPT isn't quite smart enough.. at least not yet. In another 
      2-3 years maybe it'll get to the point where it can get laughs, but it's 
      not quite there yet. 
    </p>

    <p>
      Whether it's 4 of them in a writers session, or him writing a sketch 
      himself, AI isn't there but he definitely thinks it will get there 
      eventually and thinks it will be a huge asset and boost to all 
      creators. 
    </p>

    <h3>How to Not Burnout Making The Same Video All The Time</h3>

    <p>
      Steven answered this from a few different angles. 
    </p>

    <p>
      The first - which I've already alluded to - is by changing 
      your perspective about yourself. 
    </p>

    <h4>"The Artist vs The Professional"</h4>

    <p>
      It took himself a while to learn but is an important one! 
    </p>

    <p>
      It's the artist versus the professional. 
    </p>

    <p>
      What's the difference?
    </p>

    <p>
      The artist expresses, and a professional delivers. 
    </p>

    <p>
      The difference is the direction. 
    </p>

    <p>
      The artist thinks "I want to make this story," "I think this is cool"
      "this is what I think is awesome..."
    </p>

    <p>
      Whereas a profesisonal thinks "how can I make this story for you", 
      "what can I produce for you."
    </p>

    <p>
      Sometimes the two will coincide, but Steven emphasized that 
      if for the majority of the time, if you think of yourself 
      as a professional in this sense (instead of an artist), you 
      will be happy to do your job. 
    </p>

    <h4>Context Helps A Lot</h4>

    <p>
      Meaning: he took a lot of time studying those he admired - 
      PewDiePie, MrBeast, all of the greatest comedy sketch creators 
      (Nathan Doan, Alan Chikin Chow, RDC World, CalebCity), etc.
    </p>

    <p>
      He studied all of their sketches - and one GLARINGLY obvious 
      fact is that it took ALL of these creators hundreds of tries too. 
    </p>

    <p>
      For example, it ook Mr Beast MANY years to get any views, so if 
      you're taking only 100, 200 videos to get any views, you're 
      doing pretty well relatively speaking! 
    </p>

    <h4>How To Pivot</h4>

    <p>
      Steven started off advice for pivoting by telling us 
      a cautionary tale where he mentioned how in either 
      2022 or 2023, he took some time off of his social media to instead 
      focus 100% on creating his own custom series which turned out to be 
      6 episodes and featured many of the biggest creators in the world. 
    </p>

    <p>
      In his opinion, it was a GREAT show, at least from his POV. 
    </p>

    <p>
      He invested $400,000 into the project, and it FLOPPED. 
    </p>

    <p>
      But not only did the series itself underperform, but since he 
      also posted it on his main channel, it tanked the performance 
      of all his other sketches on his channel by ~80-90%!
    </p>

    <p>
      But in the long run - as painful as this was in the short term - 
      he became a much better creator going forward after this experience. 
    </p>

    <h4>You Can't Pivot TOO HARD and Expect The Same Numbers</h4>

    <p>
      The lesson here is that you can't pivot TOO HARD and expect 
      the same numbers (at least for the same channel). 
    </p>

    <p>
      So going back to his cool analogies he made earlier, it was like
      he was Apple, and he had been making the iPhone before. 
    </p>

    <p>
      10 Million people a year lined up outside his door to buy the 
      iPhone, and he delivered it, and they were happy. 
    </p>

    <p>
      Then one year, he went "SURPRISE! HERE'S A TOASTER!" 
      and people stopped coming back as a result, largely 
      since they weren't being served what they were 
      expected and felt betrayed. 
    </p>

    <p>
      From then on, he came up with the following tactic that 
      top traditional tech companies have used: 
    </p>

    <h4>The 10% Pivot</h4>

    <p>
      What he means from this is instead of going from 3-minute 
      comedy sketches (what he made before) straight into making 
      a 12-minute TV show with different directing, different 
      writing, different cast, different cinemotography, different 
      everything, he'll only change like 10% at a time. 
    </p>

    <p>
      And since he's only changing 10% at a time, he'll test 10 
      different directions before he'll commit. 
    </p>

    <p>
      For example, he'll take a comedy sketch and MAYBE 
      add one more cast member, or make it 5 minutes instead 
      of 3 minutes, or another element of action like fight 
      choreography etc. - then whichever of these works, he'll 
      keep, and whichever flop, he'll not keep. 
    </p>

    <p>
      So instead of being Apple and pivoting from an iPhone 
      to a Toaster, this is the equivalent of now offering 
      an iPad, which is 99% of the same original experience. 
    </p>

    <h4>Don't Be Afraid To Take A LOT of Failues</h4>

    <p>
      Try like 10 directions of a 10% pivot, let 9 of them 
      fail, then double down on what does work. 
    </p>

    <h3>You Must Be Obsessed</h3>

    <p>
      Steven mentioned that you have to be all-in, that 
      it's a requirement. 
    </p>

    <p>
      As he went from an actor to a new content creator to 
      different tiers of content creation, then to where he is now, 
      and now he's met world class people from many different tiers 
      of life, he's seen one thing in common with all of them. 
    </p>

    <p>
      The observation is that the one trait that all world class 
      people have in common is obsession. He's NEVER met someone 
      who's reached that level who is not obsessed. 
    </p>

    <p>
      Kobe explained it best which is he told the story of his 
      youth and how be got into basketball, which is that initially, 
      he was an average kid, and didn't even score a point in an 
      entire season. 
    </p>

    <p>
      Then he started working more hours in the practice court 
      than everybody. 
    </p>

    <p>
      Then by the end of that first summer he was 200 hours ahead of 
      everyone else. 
    </p>

    <p>
      Then he continued doing this. 
    </p>

    <p>
      Then by year 2, 3, 4, he got thousands of hours ahead of everybody else. 
    </p>

    <p>
      By this point it would take SERIOUS dedicaiton for his peers to 
      reach his level. 
    </p>

    <p>
      Then in his pro game, he had 20,000-30,000 hours of practice ahead of everyone else. 
      By that point, no one could catch up to that 20-30,000 hours - it's virtually 
      impossible. 
    </p>

    <p>
      According to Steven, obsession is the only 100% accurate trait on this tier of professionals. 
    </p>

    <p>
      People who are THAT GOOD are usually at the point where they spend all day/night 
      thinking about it. They spend every waking moment thinking about it. 
    </p>

    <p>
      And because of all that work, they are SO FAR ahead of all their competition. 
    </p>

    <p>
      Social media is MUCH more competitive than ever. 
    </p>

    <p>
      You can't just start a youtube or tiktok channel like you could 6-10 years 
      ago and became successful without any work. 
    </p>

    <p>
      Instead, obsession will be the thing that differentiates you (and compounds 
      over time) from everyone else in today's competitive social media landscape. 
    </p>

    <h2>How To Not Burnout (In General)</h2>
    
    <p>
      "Burnout" regarding content creation is something that 
      many of the people in the audience had experienced, but 
      Steven had a very interesting take on this. 
    </p>

    <h3>With Content Creation, Steven gets the OPPOSITE of burnout</h3>

    <p>
      With content creation, Steven mentioned that he gets the REVERSE 
      of burnout - he gets itchy, like if it's Christmas and he is at home 
      not near a camera - he's drawn to doing it ALL the time. 
    </p>

    <p>
      He mentioned how he thinks about nothing but YouTube all the time (which 
      sort of harkens back to the last section). 
    </p>

    <p>
      BUT - this is another key insight here - he has burnt out in some 
      aspects and actions throughout his content creation journey. 
    </p>

    <p>
      Through the journey of content creation, there are many actions which 
      you WON'T like doing. For example - taxes, accounting, etc.
    </p>

    <p>
      BUT - this is an even bigger insight - he also emphasized how the 
      learning period of most skillsets (e.g. editing in DaVinci resolve) 
      and actions throughout will often burn you out. 
    </p>

    <h3>Burnout goes away once you upskill (or outsource)</h3>

    <p>
      HOWEVER - once you gain the skill, that burnout won't happen again. 
    </p>

    <h2>His Editing Software</h2>

    <p>
      He personally uses Da Vinci Resolve for editing, primarily because 
      it's both free and very good for editing in general. 
    </p>

    <h2>There Are Multiple Pathways To Becoming Successful</h2>

    <p>
      Steven mentioned that he might understand his niche for example - 
      e.g. engagemetn tactics, hooks, or that saturated colors in the back 
      help retention, etc. 
    </p>

    <p>
      But that some other people do it completely differently and throw everything he knows out the window
      (e.g. no writing, no shot change, no cuts, etc.) and still generate 
      millions of dollars on their content as well. 
    </p>

    <h2>All of The Biggest Channels Are Corporations</h2>

    <p>
      12 years ago or so, all the biggest channels were mainly just 
      people in their bedrooms makign videos. 
    </p>

    <p>
      More recently, it's been a shift of all creators moving towards entrepreneurialism. 
    </p>

    <p>
      The biggest ones in particular are essentially becoming corporations (using 
      entrepreneurialism to get there). 
    </p>

    <p>
      You CAN still just become a video creator, and make a living off of that - which 
      would be a great life to have - but to be a successful creator today, the goalposts 
      have shifted. You usually can't just turn on a camera and hit record in your 
      bedroom anymore. 
    </p>

    <p>
      So with Steven - at first, he was just a performer, then after 200 10% pivots, he 
      was a very good video maker, and that got him to about 10 Million Subscribers. 
    </p>

    <p>
      But to get to 100 Million Subscribers, he said he would have to obtain different 
      skills - the skillset of entrepreneurialism. 
    </p>

    <p>
      He gave another GREAT analogy to describe this. 
    </p>

    <p>
      Think of going from 0 to 10 Million followers as being similar to being a mountain 
      climber who wants to climb Mount Everest. 
    </p>

    <p>
      You have to gain the skillsets you need in order to climb Everest and get really 
      good at them. 
    </p>

    <p>
      But if you want to climb to the Moon, the same skillsets will NOT get you there! 
    </p>

    <p>
      You can even be the GREATEST at climbing Mount Everest, but in no way will 
      that skillset be useful in getting you to the moon. 
    </p>

    <p>
      In order to get to the moon, you have to learn a different skillset - how to build 
      a rocket, and how to manage all of that stuff. 
    </p>

    <p>
      THIS is the reason why all big creators have shifted to entrepreneurialism - if 
      their goal is to maximize success in income and impact, at least. 
    </p>

    <h2>Content Creators Usually Have To Do Everything In The Beginning</h2>

    <p>
      This goes without saying, but most content creators - even Steven himself - 
      have to to everything in the beginning. 
    </p>

    <p>
      The goal though is to get past the cold start problem, and once you find 
      stuff that resonates, to delegate and build out that team perhaps similarly 
      to how Steven does. 
    </p>

    <h2>All MrBeast Talks About Is YouTube...</h2>

    <p>
      Harkening back to the discussion on obsession, Steven mentioned 
      that he's met MrBeast a few times (the top content creator in 
      the world as of this writing in 2025), and that ALL MrBeast 
      talks about is YouTube - he literally doesn't talk about 
      anything else when you're in person with him.
    </p>

    <h2>MrBeast's Advice To Steven He - How To Scale Videos</h2>

    <p>
      Earlier thie year, Steven was talking to Mr Beast about 
      scaling videos, and Steven mentioned to Jimmy that he was 
      facing difficulty with respect to getting a good return 
      on his videos. 
    </p>

    <p>
      Steven, at the time, was putting 10x the budget and spend 
      into his videos, but was NOT seeing 10x the results. 
    </p>

    <p>
      Steven mentioned to Jimmy (Mr Beast) that he expected the 
      10x budget to produce 10x results, but Jimmy said "you're wrong!"
    </p>

    <p>
      Jimmy explained that it's not 10x the budget that's the issue 
      (or even necessarily the right thing to focus on), it's that 
      Steven and his team hadn't found the right thing to spend it on. 
    </p>

    <h3>Key Insight: Instead of Asking "How Much Money Should I Spend on a Video?," 
      Ask "What Element, when scaled, gives me the greatest return on investment?"</h3>

    <p>
      So from that point forward, instead of spending his time deciding 
      whether he should generally spend 10k or 50k or 100k on a video, he 
      shifted his focus and intention to "what element, when scaled, gives 
      me the greatest return on investment?"
    </p>

    <p>
      For him specifically, he looked at his 10% pivots from the last year, 
      and after looking at that, it was very obvious that the highest ROI 
      element was action - specifically action choreography (for him).
    </p>

    <p>
      So he took that specific element and REALLY doubled down on and scaled 
      that specific action. He specifically brought in the action team from 
      the movie Shang-Chi and had them drastically improve their videos. 
    </p>

    <p>
      One of the biggest sub-actions within choreography specifically was 
      fight choreography. Specifically, bigger, better action, which also 
      occured more often within the videos; to increasing spectacle, e.g. 
      including weapons, to smashing him through a table in the videos, he 
      really ramped up the action choreography to be bigger and bigger in his 
      videos ever since he isolated this variable. 
    </p>

    <h3>Steven Recommends The Sony FX3 Camera</h3>

    <p>
      He also mentioned that he uses the Sony FX3 for his content.
    </p>

    <p>
      One of my roommates is a freelance photographer/videographer (he gets 
      paid a lot to do some very cool gigs!) and I asked him about the FX3 
      after since he knows a lot about various cameras. 
    </p>

    <p>
      He believes that it's the best pound-for-pound camera in terms of 
      the price value of what you're paying. 
    </p>

    <p>
      He mentioned that there's several differences between a camera 
      like the FX3 and a camera like a modern iPhone - too many for 
      me to have remembered or go into detail with here - but the primary 
      difference between the two cameras is the bit depth which determines 
      the number of colors a camera can give you. 
    </p>

    <p>
      Apple iPhones for example, record with 8 bits, which corresponds 
      to a million discrete colors that the camera is distinguishing, whereas 
      the FX3 records with 10 bits, which is equivalent to a billion different 
      colors (a 1000x increase over the iPhone). 
    </p>

    <p>
      The human eye can distinguish (roughly) between 3 and 10 million different 
      colors (sometimes up to 100 million, but this is very rare), and the improvement 
      jumping from 8 bits to 10 bits can be especially noticeable and much more crisp, 
      especially with things like skin tone being the biggest giveaway. 
    </p>

    <p>
      The FX3 also has a much better dynamic range and works especially good 
      with shadows, contrast, and stuff like that. Sony's S-log in general 
      is very good with this. Dynamic range refers to how well a camera can 
      handle having both brights and shadows in the same shot (e.g. how 
      bright of colors or how dark of shadows it can see before it saturates 
      and you can't see anything for those parts of the video).
      
    </p>

    <p>
      The only main downside my videographer roommate mentioned about the FX3 
      is that it's not beginner friendly - primarily because it'll require 
      a lot of post-processing of the footage, which is recorded in S-Log, 
      I believe. 
    </p>

    <p>
      Something he's always said repeatedly over many conevrsations I've had 
      with him is that "any camera since 2015 is a good camera." 
    </p>

    <p>
      So the FX3 certainly isn't required but can definitely improve your 
      videos if you understand why/how it works and are ready to make 
      the investment. 
    </p>

    <h3>Tangent: Best Camera Lenses</h3>
    
    <p>
      I didn't write any notes saying if Steven recommended any 
      specific camera lenses or not, but I asked my roommate for 
      his best camera lens recommendations for the FX3 (and general 
      advice for how to think about camera lenses) and he recommended 
      likely getting the following.
    </p>

    <p>
      Usually, people who film with these types of cameras get what's 
      referred to as or called the "holy trinity" of camera lenses: the
      16-35mm, the 24-70mm, and the 70-200mm lenses. 
    </p>

    <p>
      The length that's the most commonly used across all circumstances 
      is the 24-70. It's not super wide like the 16-35mm range but not too 
      tight like the 70+ range either. This is the one that people utilize the most. 
    </p>

    <p>
      16-35mm is more often used for wide shots, and 70-200mm is more often 
      used for tighter shots. 
    </p>

    <p>
      The other primary consideration with lenses is the aperature or "f-stop" 
      number which you see on lenses. A lower f-stop, like f/1.8 is better than 
      a higher stop of f/2.8, which is better than an even higher stop of f/4; lower 
      aperature essentially means lower light or bokeh (or blurriness, I think). 
    </p>

    <p>
      If you had to go with one lens, 24-70 might be the best, and he also did 
      mention that 50mm in particular is special since it's the same focal length 
      of the human eye (give or take) so that's always a solid all-around versatile 
      option. 
    </p>

    <p>
      Personally I myself don't know a ton about camera lenses, but hopefully 
      this gave a good intro on the topic! 
    </p>

    <p>
      Steven actually did talk about lenses in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NEhIKWkUXE">This Video From 2022</a> 
      on YouTube where he talks all about camera equipment and lenses. It's a bit outdated (since he uses the FX3 now) but 
      definitely gives A LOT of great insights on lenses etc. 
    </p>

    <p>
      He thinks that they can add A TON to story telling (whether it's focal length, f-stop, or focus). 
    </p>

    <p>
      Steven himself explicitly states here that he likes the 50mm lens since it's a visual style that 
      makes the viewer feel as if he/she is in the room with him (alluding back to what my videography 
      friend said about 50mm being similar to the focal length of the human eye) since that's a normal 
      field of view or perspective. 
    </p>

    <p>
      And if he has multiple characters in a scene, he likes placing the camera between the two (and then 
      flipping it) as he demonstrates in 13:00 of the above video (or, simply, between cuts, 
      he puts the camera at the previous person's perspective for example), which makes the videos feel even 
      more immersive for the audience/viewer (in addition to the more natural type focal length). 
    </p>

    <p>
      He also mentions that using a 50mm prime lens for all shots (instead of using a zoom 
      lens for tighter shots) is what he prefers - since he would simply move the 50mm closer for 
      tighter shots. Staying at 50mm (but moving the camera closer or farther as needed) is the 
      ideal.
    </p>

    <h3>Focus on Instagram For Short-Form</h3>

    <p>
      According to Steven, while TikTok was the king of short form for 
      several years (e.g. early 2020s), the biggest opportunity right 
      now lies in instagram (and youtube shorts) for short-form. I can't 
      write down the reason for that here, but he emphasized that instagram 
      and shorts (especially instagram) are where people should focus on 
      for short-form growth. 
    </p>

    <h3>Key Insight: Screw Virality - Focus on a Repeatable Audience Experience (RAP) Instead</h3>

    <p>
      Steven mentioned that if he were starting over, he'd probably focus on short-form 
      first. And maybe he'd also do some sort of long-form videos that could be derived 
      and cut up into short-form videos easily (e.g. one 3-minute comedy sketch that 
      could be cut up into three one-minute videos). 
    </p>

    <p>
      However, a key insight which Steven mentioned is that you SHOULD NOT focus 
      on virality (e.g. doing a water bottle flip video that goes viral or some 
      random thing which goes viral, etc.). 
    </p>

    <p>
      He doesn't care much about going viral, because virality is a one-shot thing. 
    </p>

    <p>
      Virality in the one-shot sense does not create a lasting impression. 
    </p>

    <p>
      This isn't something that can give you lasting success, at least not in 
      the sense of making good money (e.g. a million dollars a year). 
    </p>

    <p>
      So perosnally, Steven focuses on "creating an audience experience" that 
      they will always want to come back to. 
    </p>

    <p>
      The most effective way to do this is to flip the perspective, and think of yourself 
      as a viewer, and observe all the things you watch, and from there, dissect 
      why you watch certain channels that much. 
    </p>

    <p>
      This studying (which we've alluded to a ton throughout this article) will teach 
      you a lot more than the optimizing and 10% parts alone. 
    </p>

    <h2>The Optimization Process</h2>

    <p>
      To reiterate Steven's optimization process from earlier (since this is so 
      important), it's about: 
    </p>

    <p>
      Trying 100 different things, most of then won't work, then you'll be lucky 
      if one thing does work. 
    </p>

    <p>
      But you can change the speed at which you STUDY alongside this optimization 
      process, and this studying will help you the most in how fast your channel 
      will pop off. 
    </p>

    <p>
      For example, if you only study one channel as you do your optimization 
      process, it might take 300 videos to pop off for example. But if you study 
      like 50 or 100 channels, you might be able to hit it in the first 20. 
    </p>

    <p>
      Hard work will be absolutely required either way, but the SPEED at which you're successful 
      is something he believes can be accelerated through this process, in his 
      opinion. 
    </p>

    <h2>Steven's Process for Studying Other Channels</h2>

    <p>
      Here's a quick rehash of Steven's study process for studying other creators
      and learning more quickly: 
    </p>

    <p>
      Study examples of successful people as described above, study your own 
      channel (your own data, metrics, what the platforms give you), and use 
      that - find your weaknesses and hone in on them. 
    </p>

    <p>
      e.g. if it's retention, seek techniques to improve your retention, 
      try 10 different things, then 8-9 might not work, but the 1-2 
      that do work will be ones you want to hone in on and become good at. Then 
      you will have that "feather in your quiver" so to speak. 
    </p>

    <p>  
      Then once you solve your videos weaknesses, you will be a powerful enough 
      creator to command that viewership. 
    </p>

    <h2>Steven's Thoughts on One Channel vs. Seperate Channels</h2>

    <p>
      The last thing that we asked Steven, if I remember right, was a question along the lines 
      of whether we should post all of our videos on one channel or seperate different 
      types of videos on different channels (e.g. if you posted lifestyle content before 
      but started making a different type of video - should you keep that on the same 
      page or make it a seperate niche?).
    </p>

    <p>
      Steven's response was something along the lines of that he's talked to a lot of 
      people about this topic over the years. 
    </p>

    <p>
      And with his channels specifically, if he puts non main channel content on the 
      main channel, then performance dips and that also drags down the next couple of 
      uploads, since - if we go back to the previous iPhone vs Toaster or Burrito vs 
      Avocado Toast analogies - we gave the audience a negative experience. 
    </p>

    <p>
      In this case, they were expecting either a burrito or an iPhone, but they did not 
      get the burrito or iPhone. Thus, they won't come the next time. 
    </p>

    <p>
      YouTube has, more recently, stated the case that the algorithm is now powerful 
      enough and smart enough to be able to know the difference and serve it to 
      two different audiences/demos automatically. 
    </p>

    <p>
      But while YouTube maintains that the algorithm is powerful enough to know 
      the difference now, Steven is still a bit conflicted on this since he thinks 
      that uploading two different content types on the main channel still has a 
      negative impact on his main channel's performance. 
    </p>

    <p>
      So for the time being, he thinks that people should start new channels for 
      different niches and keep those channels seperate. 
    </p>

    <h2>Summary</h2>

    <p>
      Steven's USC Talk was an absolute masterclass in content creation 
      -- he gave tangible analogies and strategies which transformed 
      my thinking about content creation and the process for getting 
      better at content fast. 
    </p>

    <p>
      To briefly summarize, the high-points of the talk were:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Steven's background and his story of becoming a creator</li>
      <li>To treat content creation like a traditional business with traditional product lines</li>
      <li>Steven's system for finding social media success: Fail 100-200 times, optimize along the way, then double down on the one thing that works</li>
      <li>His iPhone vs Toaster, and Breakfast Burrito vs Avocado Toast Business Analogies</li>
      <li>Instagram (currently) is king when it comes to short-form</li>
      <li>Avoiding "Burnout" doing the same thing: The Artist vs The Professional</li>
      <li>You can't pivot too hard and expect the same numbers</li>
      <li>How To Pivot: The 10% Rule</li>
      <li>Don't be afraid to take A LOT of failures</li>
      <li>All top performers are OBSESSED</li>
      <li>Burnout goes away once you upskill (and/or outsource)</li>
      <li>Focus on the highest ROI element rather than blindly investing more in your videos</li>
      <li>Forget virality - focus on a Repeatable Audience Experience (RAP) instead</li>
      <li>Steven's optimiztion process (mentioned several times)</li>
      <li>Steven's process for studying other channels</li>
      <li>Steven's thoughts on posting on one channel vs multiple seperate channels</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Steven gave A LOT of tactical advice, and it's definitely a LONG read, but totally worth it 
      if you're a creator and are looking to improve. I personally gained a completely new 
      perspective and look forward to applying this to my own content creation going 
      forward as I hopefully look forward to becoming a full time creator soon.
