    <h1>Lessons From Three Entrepreneurs in Their Early-Mid 20s</h1>
    <p class="meta">Jan 8, 2026 · Category: Entrepreneurship, Social Media</p>

    <p>
      On January 28th, 2025, I had the chance to attend an entrepreneurship 
      panel at my school, the University of Southern California, which 
      featured three young and successful Founders who gave their advice 
      for breaking into entrepreneurship, particularly in the social 
      media age. 
    </p>

     alt="Learning curve"
     style="display:block; margin:1.5rem auto; width:800px; height:auto;">

    <p>
      The three founders were Jacob Pace, 26; Sam Freeman, 23; and Jenna Gestetner, 22. 
    </p>

    <p>
      While the talk was almost a year ago, I vividly remember the energy and enthusiasm 
      that all three founders had, which was extremely infectious, and I'm connected 
      to all three to this day in some capacity. 
    </p>

    <p>
      While the vast majority of my days being  grad student were spend on relatively boring 
      technical research, the real value I saw out of USC (beyond a base technical foundation) was 
      the opportunity to meet successful entreprenurs, creators, and people like this. 
    </p>

    <p>
      I was actually a bit late and missed about half of the talk, but I still learned a lot 
      from the last part and from the Q&A after. 
    </p>

    <p>
      Without further ado, let's get to the takeaways from my notes!
    </p>

    <h2>Leverage is EVERYTHING - Jacob Pace</h2>

    <p>
      Without even looking at my notes, by far the biggest takeaway I got from this 
      talk which I've thought about everyday since is something that Jacob Pace told me after 
      which was about leverage. 
    </p>

    <p>
      He mentioned that leverage is EVERYTHING - whether it's with respect to business, 
      schooling/education, getting jobs, or even in things like dating. 
    </p>

    <p>
      The main reason you want to build leverage, in his opinino, is because he thinks
      you shouldn't trust most people too much. 
    </p>

    <p>
      Because he thinks, in careers and in business, there's ALWAYS going to be people 
      who try to take advantage of you. 
    </p>

    <p>
      Jacob Pace thinks that the way you can defend yourself against people who do 
      try to take advantage of you (and instead be around those who are fair or who 
      you actually want to be around) is to build more leverage for yourself. 
    </p>

    <p>
      Because at the end of the day, you're the only person who's going to look out 
      for you. 
    </p>

    <p>
      And he also mentioned how the best relationships are ALWAYS going to be the ones 
      where you both respect each other and see mutual value in each other. 
    </p>

    <p>
      From this point forward, this completely transformed my mental model for how I view 
      all of these situations and life in general - leverage is king, that's for sure. 
    </p>

    <p>
      As a quick example, there's a YouTuber - who I haven't met - called Derek Munro, whose content I 
      started watching shortly after this talk and he gave a ton of great examples of leverage 
      in different contexts throughout his life which only further validated this in my head.
    </p>

    <p>
      I've thought of my career, content, and almost everything in terms of leverage and 
      the other lessons that Jacob taught here - which will be invaluable to me going forward. 
    </p>

    <p>
      Jacob - if you're reading this, thank you! This piece of advice has DEFINITELY 
      transformed my thinking over the past year and will continue to do so going forward. 
    </p>

    <h2>How To Get Your First Experience</h2>

    <p>
      Sam - Prioritize learning at first over making money, but create some sort 
      of incentive structure where you can make money as you learn, through 
      the value you're providing to that project. 
    </p>

    <p>
      Jenna - you should have the mindset that you provide value JUST by 
      being yourself, let alone the fact that you have your skills, experience, 
      and knowledge on top of that. Even if you have none of those, you provide 
      value just by being yourself and by bringing a new and fresh perspective on things.
    </p>
