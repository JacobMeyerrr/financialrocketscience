    <h1>Business Lessons From 3 25 Year Old Multimillionaire Founders (FanFix)</h1>
    <p class="meta">Jan 7, 2026 · Category: Social Media</p>

    <p>
      On February 18th, 2025, I was very lucky to get the chance to tour 
      FanFix HQ in West Hollywood, CA as one of approximately a dozen or 
      so USC students who are involved in Social Media in some capacity. 
    </p>

    <p>
      The highlight of the tour was the chance to both have a formal 
      Q&A and then a meet and greet with the cofounders - Harry Gestetner 
      and Simon Pompan - both the same age as me at the time (~25 years old) 
      but were multimillionaires who had exited their business at 21 
      years old in 2022. 
    </p>

    <p>
      It was definitely super inspiring to get to meet and talk to 
      entrepreneurs our age who have done this, and it showed that 
      entrepreneurship doesn't have to wait until an arbitrary date 
      into the future, but rather can be done when you're young and 
      in your early/mid 20s, especially if your business serves those 
      in our generation (Gen Z). 
    </p>

    <p>
      This article will be a little bit concise and straight to the 
      point compared to some of my articles, but it has some of the best 
      business and entrepreneurship advice that I've personally 
      ever received so far. 
    </p>

    <h2>Side-Note: Why I'm Writing These Articles (feel free to skip)</h2>

    <p>
      If you're reading this, you might be wondering what the purpose 
      of me writing these blog posts and articles are. 
    </p>

    <p>
      Because after all - as Harry and Simon said in their talk here even - 
      success in business, career, and life in general often just comes 
      down to execution, so why spend time writing this all out? 
    </p>

    <p>
      It's because as a part of my Master's and PhD in Astronautical Engineering 
      at USC, I've mastered pretty much all of rocket science - to the point where 
      I've been interviewed by top space companies like NASA, SpaceX, and others 
      which you'd recognize, without getting a single technical question wrong. 
    </p>

    <p>
      Long story short - with rocket science as my first application of this - I've 
      learned how to get REALLY good at REALLY HARD things fast. It literally almost 
      doesn't get much harder than rocket science. 
    </p>

    <p>
      In order to not fail out of the PhD, I had to memorize EVERY equation and concept 
      from all of my Astronautical Engineering Master's courses and know how to do 
      problems from all of those classes completely by hand without the use of any 
      computer, notes sheets, or anything, in order to pass an exam I had to take 
      called my "Screening Exam." 
    </p>

    <p>
      I may or may not make a more in-depth article on my process for that and 
      also observations I've had over time, but I'll summarize briefly here. 
    </p>

    <p>
      Long story short, while I'd taken and passed all of the classes which 
      we were tested on on the qual exam before - Space Systems Engineering, 
      Plasma Physics, Space Environment, Spacecraft and Rocket Propulsion, 
      and Orbital Mechanics - I usually just sat through lectures and took 
      exams while retaining enough information to pass before forgetting 
      most of what I learned shortly after finishing the class and exams. 
    </p>

    <p>
      So while I technically took the classes and could brush up on the material 
      if I needed to, I didn't TRULY understand the material to the point where 
      I could ace technical interviews or apply the concepts in real-world scenarios
      without much though or effort. My understanding of the material AFTER 
      organizing it, breaking it down to the deepest level, and memorizing it all 
      was SIGNIFICANTLY higher. 
    </p>

    <p>
      Now that I look back on it, I feel like a lot of the creator talks or opportunities 
      that I've had the opportunity to attend over the years probably go the same way. 
    </p>

    <p>
      For the most part, if I map my screening exam learning process onto the creator 
      talks I've had the chance to attend over the years, I think that the learning probably 
      maps very similarly to the benefit you get from passively sitting through classes/lecture 
      then forgetting most of the material versus going back through your notes and 
      applying the principles I did to truly understand the material at a different level.
    </p>

    <p>
      I'm such a voracious note-taker sometimes that another PhD student even called me 
      out on it, saying that their philosiphy is that "if somthing is important enough, 
      you'll remember it (rather than having to jot it down in the notes app on my 
      iPhone)" and while I definitely agree with this in a lot of contexts, my USC 
      Astronautical Engineering PhD Screening Exam experience (and experience learning 
      other hard things) implies otherwise for learning hard things at a deep level. 
    </p>

    <p>
      While this won't make sense on its own, the main principles I learned for studying 
      hard things, from that exam, were 1) "Understand The Why", and 2) "Drill, Drill, Drill" 
      (good examples). It's somewhat similar to the principles I outlined in my Standup 
      Comedy Article on how to get better at comedy.
