    <h1>Zack Honarvar (Manager of Airrack and Yes Theory) Podcast Notes</h1>
    <p class="meta">Feb 7, 2026 · Category: Entrepreneurship, Social Media</p>

    <p>
      On November 2nd, 2022, Zack Honarvar - then the Manager of Airrack and Yes Theory - 
      came to USC to give a talk both talking about his background and to give advice to 
      USC Students interested in pursuing a career in the creator economy.

    <p>Caption: Zack and I when we ran into each other at Coachella 2025 2-1/2 years 
    after his Fall 2022 USC Talk</p>

    <p>
      I took a lot of notes during the talk on my iPhone notes app and finally got 
      around to synthesizing them into a blog post about a month ago. 
    </p>

    <p>
      In the blog post synthesizing those notes from his 2022 USC talk, I also did an extensive deep dive on 
      his 2018 talk "How to Hack The Corporate World To Become An Entrepreneur" that, in his 2022 talk, he recommended we watch ], and 
      he gave a ton of useful advice which was even more applicable to people my age since 
      he hadn't started his first business yet but was about to. 
    </p>

    <p>
      Looking back, in early 2026, which is over 3 years since his late 2022 talk, which itself was over 4 
      years after his 2018 talk, he's only become more and more successful as time has gone on and it's 
      clear that he knows what he's talking about when it comes to all things entrepreneurship. 
    </p>

    <p>
      He's clearly a winner in the space, so I thought it that for this article, it would be worth 
      revisiting a couple of his older podcast appearances - from 2019 and 2022 - and take notes, and 
      see how close his predictions were to coming true. 
    </p>

    <p>
      Spoiler alert, he turned out to be very right. 
    </p>

    <p>
      What I like about Zach is that he's a true entrepreneur and businessman and not just some 
      online "business guru" who's trying to sell you a course. This guy has genuinely build and sold 
      multiple seven and eight figure businesses and has no agenda on his podcast appearances. 
    </p>

    <p>
      And his entrepreneurship principles are universal and often translate across disciplines and 
      they stand the test of time - what he taught in 2018 or 2019 is just as relevant if not more 
      relevant than ever today. 
    </p>

    <p>
      Without further ado, let's dive right into the analysis!
    </p>

    <p2>The Episodes I'm Analyzing Today</p2>

    <p>
      The first podcast I'm going to take notes on is from March 2019, oneof 
      Zack's early podcast appearances, before TikTok was really a huge thing 
      and only one year after he took the plunge to full time entrepreneur. 
    </p>

     style="display:block; margin:1.5rem auto; width:800px; height:auto;">


    <p2>Zack's Early Journey</p2>

    <p>
      He started off mentioning that he was born in Iran and 
      then moved to Toronto Canada at 4 years old. 
    </p>

    <p>
      He talked about his childhood and he also went through 
      school and talked about his view that most of what he 
      learned in early school wasn't super relevant to his future. 
    </p>

    <p>
      He then went to college and studied economics and business.
      He knew that he wanted to be an entrepreneur, but his first 
      initial thoughts going into university were that this would be
      a good way to both establish connections and learn the ropes 
      of business while he came up with his idea(s). 
    </p>

    <p>
      He did mention that business school didn't teach him and real or 
      relevant business skills at all though, but what it did give him 
      was his network and that it "put him in the room." 
    </p>

    <p>
      It didn't necessarily give him useful skills, in his opinion, but 
      again, it unlocked the next set of opportunities for him at least. 
    </p>

    <p>
      He also thinks that university taught him how to work hard due to 
      the deadlines, etc. even though most of what he learned wasn't 
      really that practical. And that working hard translated well to 
      becoming an entrepreneur. 
    </p>

    <p3>What was he like in college?</p3>

    <p>
      People said to him that "college are the best years of your life" 
      and he HATED hearing that. He wanted to set the roots and foundation 
      to make sure that they weren't the best years of his life. 
    </p>

    <p>
      He was ALWAYS looking for opportunities and ways ot make money. 
    </p>

    <p>
      He was always looking for some opportunity to create a supply/demand scenario 
      where he could provide some type of service or product that the prople around 
      him wanted or needed. 
    </p>

    <p>
      And he also just needed to get the minimum grades. He mentioned that, in his 
      opinion, people don't look at your grades but just see that you have the piece 
      of paper. 
    </p>

    <p>
      And that a lot of entrepreneurs actually had this mindset too, and then went 
      super risky in the startups and businesses they evtnaully wanted to start. 
    </p>

    <p>
      As a side-note -- I literally just saw an instagram reel (as of Feb 2026) of 
      a more recent college dropout/entrepreneur - Roy Lee, CoFounder of Cluely AI, 
      mentioning he did this exact same thing. He did the minimum viable effort for 
      his CS classes, even racking up a lot of C- grades, but he poured the vast majority 
      of his energy into his side-business and eventually started Cluely and dropped out, 
      which turned out to make him a billionaire. 
    </p>

    <p>
      So Zack, as always, was right on here. 
    </p>

    <p>
      Another thing is that College taught Zack what he DIDN'T want to do! 
    </p>

    <p>
      For example, he worked at a company called SunLife Financial and learned he 
      DIDN'T want to get into investment banking - more on this later. 
    </p>

    <p>
      As far as side hustles he tried in college, he started a tutoring company and 
      hired people to tutor students for exams at class, and they made good money. 
    </p>

    <p>
      This consisted mainly of review sessions for big classes right before exams, led 
      by people who excelled in the classes before. Zack paid the people $60/hour to 
      lead these review sessions (~2-3 hours each) and charged the students ~$10-15/hour 
      to get in the door for the review sessions (they'd always fill up super well). 
    </p>

    <p>
      He'd market these by standing out the lecture halls of the class after the class ended 
      and handout flyers for it and always get an insane turnout. 
    </p>

    <p>
      This wasn't his long term game, but was a decent revenue driver in the short term. 
    </p>

    <p3>His Entrepreneurial Mindset & Approach Early On</p3>

    <p>  
      He was always asked what he wanted to be long-term though, and he always said "entrepreneur," 
      but people always then asked "what's your million dollar idea?" 
    </p>

    <p>
      And Zack didn't know what his eureka moment or big idea would be at the time, BUT he realized 
      that if he didn't have the skills set up for hiring, or marketing, or sales, that he would let 
      that opportunity pass by him and not be able to take advantage of it. 
    </p>

    <p>
      So at some point, he also said to himself that "this idea doesn't have to be it," and that he 
      would dive into every opportunity with a learning mindset and that those skills would then transfer 
      whenever the big idea did eventually come. 
    </p>

    <p3>Super Cool Laptop Story</p3>

    <p>
      Zack also talked about how he was dead broke and his laptop broke, 
      and how he needed a new one in order to learn entrepenership, but he 
      couldn't afford it. 
    </p>

    <p>
      In a super creative move, he strategically approached a ton of local 
      businesses and said he would etch their logos in the back of his laptop 
      and also write articles about them if he was able to raise enough money 
      to get one and if he was able to do with it what he wanted, and he did - 
      having earned enough $$ (~$1600) to get a Macbook Air and then becoming 
      known as "the entrepeneur guy" around campus after that. 
    </p>

    <p>
      He treated his laptop as advertising space, came up with a creative 
      solution and story to sell the space, and it worked out super well for him 
      despite being an absolutely broke student deeply in debt at the time. 
    </p>

    <p2>Post-Grad</p2>

    <p>
      He went on to work at Sunlife Financial full-time since they offered 
      him the most money, and to both save up for being an entrepreneur and to 
      pay off his student loans as soon as possible, but he found it super draining 
      and that it sucked the entrepeneurial energy right out of him. 
    </p>

    <p>
      He realized that what you do with your 9-5 can influence your 5-9 hustle and 
      really drain you. 
    </p>

    <p>
      So he quit and decided to do a sales job - even if it paid a lot less at 
      first - and that it needed to be at a startup. 
    </p>

    <p>
      He determined that sales was the number one skill for being an entrepreneur 
      and that being at a startup specifically would allow him to wear a lot of 
      hats and allow him to have the biggest impact on the business. 
    </p>

    <p>
      So he went on to Shopify, and that's where he spent the next 3+ years!
    </p>

    <p>
      Over the next few years, Shopify went from a few hundred people when he 
      started to over 4,000. 
    </p>

    <p>
      He specifically was in enterprise sales, which is essentially selling to large companies. 
    </p>

    <p3>His Biggest Takeaways From The Shopify Job</p3>

    <p>
      Sales Skills. 
    </p>

    <p>
      Being able to figure out what the process of successfully selling something is. 
    </p>

    <p>
      And switching the conception in his mind of what sales is. 
    </p>

    <p>
      Sales ISN'T being able to sell anything to anyone or convincing someone that they want something (that they don't need). 
    </p>

    <p>
      Instead, <b>sales is about just finding people who are interested in the thing and removing the frictions and the unknowns and if they need it, and if so, what version they need. </b>
    </p>

    <p>
      Sales is NOT slimy in his opinion, but you should reframe it to what's above. 
    </p>

    <h3>Networking With Founders at Shopify</h3>

    <p>
      He was also super lucky to get the opportunity to get on the phone with a ton of 
      founders during his time at Shopify. 
    </p>

    <p>
      A lot of his conversations were about learning about those businesses, getting on the phone with those founders, 
      since understanding them and their business models helped him sell better. 
    </p>

    <p>
      Then he would mention to them "this is what we provide, and in my opinon, how you can take your business ot the next level."
    </p>

    <p>
      So because of this, he was able ot get exposure to a ton of different 
      business models, which later on helped him become an entrepreneur. 
    </p>

    <p>
      The question he always asked himself is <b>"this is what they (these businesses) 
      need, and this is how they get to the next level..."</b>
    </p>

    <p3>Zack's Bold Proclamation During His Shopify Interview</p3>

    <p>
      In his interview, he boldly said that "this is gonna be the last job I'm ever 
      gonna have. I'm gonna quit my job one day and become an entrepreneur. As long 
      as you guys are ok with me using you guys to learn these sales skills, then 
      we have an agreement." 
    </p>

    <p>
      And surprisingly and awesomely, Shopify was like "WE LOVE YOUR TRANSPARENCY, 
      Hell yeah! We just want people who are down to learn how to sell." 
    </p>

    <p>
      And while he was there, it allowed him to work very entrepreneurially. 
    </p>

    <p>
      And as long as you're good in sales, you can do whatever the heck you 
      want in your company. 
    </p>

    <p>
      He also paid his student loans off and kept learning a ton. 
    </p>

    <h3>When He Quit Shopify</h3>

    <p>
      Eventually though, he wrote in his journal that "I don't feel like I'm 
      learning anymore, so change needs to happen." Where he wasn't learning 
      anything substantially more than he was 6 months, 1 year earlier. 
    </p>

    <p>
      Earleir on, he was figuring out a new business, or learning a new tactic 
      and how it has success, or learning how to start the call talking about them 
      and not me, or learning not to care about the deal too much, how to manage 
      people, etc. - he started to accumulate all of these skills, but eventually 
      plateaud in learning. 
    </p>

    <h3>What He Did Afterwards</h3>

    <p>
      During his time at Shopify, he'd come to LA all the time to work with these 
      brands and so on and so forth, and eventually met the yes theory guys. 
    </p>

    <p>
      Someone who knew both Zack and Yes Theory said they should meet and he made 
      the intro between the two. They immediately hit it off and had shared values, 
      and Yes Theory said "if you're ever back in LA, stay on our couch" and coincidentlaly 
      he was back in LA a week later. 
    </p>

    <p>
      He loved the community that hung out around the Yes Theory house so he said yes 
      to that instead of staying in the hotel room that Shopify always paid for when 
      he visited LA since he wouldn't meet anyone cool or interesting at the hotel. 
    </p>

    <p>
      One of the times Zack was over, the Yes Theory guys were looking over a potential 
      merch deal/contract and they asked Zach if he could look it over and help them. 
    </p>

    <p>
      Since he was working in apparel at Shopify, he was able to connect and get them 
      set up properly, and go from there. 
    </p>

    <p>
      Some of their other creator friends doing merch asked them how they got setup 
      and they referred them to Zack, and from there he decided to start an apparel 
      / merchandising company with Yes Theory called "Fan of a Fan."
    </p>

    <p>
      He also fell in love with Venice (Beach) and (for good reason!) and decided to 
      move in LA a few months later after he would wrap things up with Shopify. 
    </p>

    <p>
      Instead of quitting right on the spot, he interestingly enough went up to 
      Shopify next time he was back in Toronto and said "Hey Listen! I think the 
      next thing for me entrepreneurially is in LA, but I'm not ready to leave you 
      guys yet. Is there a way that you guys can send me to LA?" and Shopify was like 
      "Let's figure this out." 
    </p>

    <p>
      Then next time he talked to Yes Theory, they said "Hey, you should manage us 
      on the side" and that's when he went in his journal and wrote "I'm not learning 
      anything anymore" and decided right then and there to take the entrepreneurial leap. 
    </p>

    <p>
      So he decided to manage the guys full time and open up his One-Day Entertainment office. 
    </p>

    <h2>Moving to LA & His Approach To Going Full Time</h2>

    <p>
      So it took 4 months for his VISA to get approved (since he was moving from 
      Canada to the USA), so in the meantime he built his confidence in his entrepreneurial 
      venture by doing a TON of research in his spare time since he didn't know ANYTHING
      about content creation back then. 
    </p>

    <p>
      So he did his research and felt condifent, then the day of the flight was when Will Smith 
      responded to Yes Theory and then 1 week later, Zack's meeting with WIll Smith's manager of 
      17 years which was amazing! 
    </p>

    <p>
      The learning curve, as a consequence, was so much steeper, and he ended up learning what would 
      take most people years to learn, he learned in months. 
    </p>

    <h3>On Dealing With Negative Self-Talk</h3>

    <p>
      The negative self-talk he had in his mind before leaving for LA, quitting his job, was that he would 
      decide major life decisions in ONE DAY and then commit to things FULLY and have those negative 
      thoughts dissapear as soon as he makes the decision. 
    </p>

    <h3>On Additional Mindset Stuff</h3>

    <p>
      Setting attainable goals for yourself and achieving those is a great way to build self-confidence.
    </p>

    <p>
      In addition, don't think "if something worked out for this person, it won't work for me." Instead, 
      Zack has the mindset "If it worked out for them, I'll be able to figure out a way to to it too" which is 
      a huge mindset shift. 
    </p>

    <p>
      If he wants to do something, he thinks he can, it's just a matter of time until he does it. 
    </p>

    <p>
      Once you have these mindsets and execute on prior goals, you should be able to have conviction 
      in similar leaps in the future. 
    </p>

    <h2>Zack's Predictions on The Future of Content Creation (in 2019)</h2>
    <p>
      
    </p>
      After talking about Zack's backstory in the previous segment, his new segment 
      talked about his views on the future and direction of content creation as he 
      saw it in 2019. 
    <p>

    </p>
      This segment is probably more valuable to most readers than his backstory (which itself 
      has A TON of great lessons in it), and the thing is - his predictions that he said here 
      in March 2019 about short-form video taking off, and social media platforms shifting 
      towards a Mobile-first approach and the way content businesses work (content/marketing 
    first, producrt later) were SPOT ON for what was going to happen in the years ahead. 
    <p>

    </p>
      And this was before TikTok was even a thing yet, so the fact that he got these predictions 
      right in early 2019 (and the fact that he continues to spot upcoming trends to the modern day) 
      is incredible and a testament to how much of a business genius he is when it comes to the 
      content world. 
    <p>

    <h3>The Business Structure of Content Creation</h3>

    </p>
      When asked how he thinks content creation will change in the next 5-10 years, Zack 
      started off giving a unique answer which contrasted how content works compared to 
      traditional businesses. 
    <p>

    </p>
      First, he said that traditional businesses like Nike, or Apple, or Lululemon started off 
      with either a physical product or a service, and then in order to build a brand around that 
      product they would build content around it after. 
    <p>

    </p>
      What's different about content creation, in a business sense, is that they start first with that 
      content, and then that content expands to creating physical products or services that vibe with the 
      content (content first, products/services later). 
    <p>

    </p>
      With Yes Theory for example, the content was a philosiphy and an ideology. And that makes 
      people feel a certain way. 
    <p>

    </p>
      And you have to be careful to build a business around it so that it vibes in a good way with 
      the content. 
    <p>

    </p>
      In his opionion, you should keep the main thing - the content - free, and build businesses 
      around it so you can transact with the audience in that way. 
    <p>

    <h3>Everything's Going Mobile</h3>

    </p>
      He noticed that as of 2019, and the year or two before, he saw everyone at shopify and on 
    youtube and so on as going mobile and using those aps on their phones way more than their 
    computers etc. 
    <p>

    </p>
      This prediction of Zack's was SPOT ON, looking back on it. 
    <p>

    </p>
      Furthermore, he expanded to say that he was extremely bullish on short-form video, which 
      looking back, is another VERY CORRECT prediction, and it's more insane he's doing that 
      particularly since he's predating TikTok or any short-form vertical platforms taking off. 
    <p>

    </p>
      Funny enough though, he thought that IGTV would be the version of vertical video that would 
      take off, and he was very bullish on that, or whatever vertical video form or app would 
      take over. 
    <p>

    </p>
      He thought that flipping your phone over to look at non-vertical video would be too much 
      friction for consumers to want to bear and he was 100% right. 
    <p>

    </p>
      Now IGTV wasn't the exact form of that - Reels on Instagram 2-1/2 years later would be 
      the version of it that would take off, after TikTok's success, but he was SPOT ON 
      with vertical video being the future. 
    <p>

    </p>
      And he mentioned how lots of people criticized the idea of short-form vertical video 
      at the time saying that it would be too much extra work for people to make that on top 
      of long-form, but that this viewpoint only solidified his opinion that it would be 
      successful, since it was such a contrarian idea at the time (which in hindsight, is 
      insane to think that it was so contrarian). 
    <p>

    <h3>*HUGE* Question To Zack: What is Good Content?</h3>
      
    </p>
      He thinks that good content is content that is something being made that falls back to that 
      company's or creator's why. 
    <p>

    </p>
      As opposed to doing something which the creator thinks will simply get maximum views, or 
      what they think will have success on the algorithm. This is where he thinks content becomes 
      bad, even if it works. This is when it's pranks, or misleading titles, etc. 
    <p>

    </p>
      Bad content like this is unsustainable, is a fad, and won't last. But good content ties back 
      to the values of the creator, their mission, - whether it gets one view or a million views - 
      which people are doing for the right reason, not for commercial success. 
    <p>

    <h3>How to break through as a creator? </h3>

    </p>
      Number one, if you don't need any financial success right away and have 
      that cushion, that's a great place to start off. 
    <p>

    </p>
      Secondly, if you are an early adopter of a new platform (such as IGTV or short-form vertical 
      video like Zack is mentioning), you are going to be at the forefront of that platform and 
      determining how that platform is digested, and you'll grow with the platform. 
    <p>

    </p>
      Post on the future platform which you are betting on, and you'll be able to grow 
      along with it if it is ultimately successful. 
    <p>

    </p>
      Always watch trends in your industry, be aware of the up and coming platforms that will 
      disrupt youtube, instagram, etc. so you have a fighting chance before it's too late. 
    <p>

    <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>

    </p>
      Overall, Zack had a lot of great lessons from his backstory AND gave a ton of great 
      advice in how to navigate the world as a creator which all apply today. 
    <p>

    </p>
      Furthermore, he gave a ton of spot on predictions about the direction that social media 
      was headed that were well ahead of its time, further showing how he's continued to be 
      right over the years and how he's one of the best voices in the content space to listen to.
