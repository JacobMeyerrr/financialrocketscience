      <li>Books & Book Reviews</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      While going much more in-depth and talking about them in a much less "clickbait" way than short-form content allows for. 
    </p>

    <p>
     Most of what I'm talking about here is usually me talking 
     about what I wish a past version of myself would've known 
     a few years earlier, whether it's in terms of health, fitness, 
     social skills, comedy, career, college, grad school, finances, 
     AI, social media, high performance, or anything related to 
     self-actualization in general. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Some of these things, I got very lucky and lucked into early, and other things I talk 
      about are things I didn't know about or implement right away, but wish that I had known earlier
      which could've saved months or years of effort. 
    </p>
    <p>
      As a disclaimer, this is fully a personal blog and isn't reflective of the opinion 
      of my school or anyone who employs me, past or present - it simply contains my own opinions 
      and reflections on my personal life experiences, hopefully organized in a way which is helpful to people. 
    </p>
    <p>
      However, I'm hoping that others who have had similar struggles or 
      been through similar situations can gain useful and actionable insights, even if I never
       make a single dollar off of this blog, which is completely free. 
    </p>
    <p>
      I believe that it's very important that I organize my thoughts either
      as I'm going through situations or after I'd recently been through them, rather
       than years down the line once I've forgotten many of the details. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Whether it's college admissions, or getting better at comedy, or overall social
       development or career progrssion, I think that documenting lessons learned while I'm in the middle
       of those phases of self-development could be very valuable since after the fact, 
       you tend to forget many of the helpful details that ultimately helped you become successful. 
    </p>
    <p>
      I should also make it clear that I'm not an expert in any of these topics, but think 
      that my thoughts could be helpful since if an ordinary guy like me can find success, 
      then anyone can ultimately be successful in these areas of life. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Sometimes, advice from so-called experts isn't as applicable or practical since
      they are oftentimes so far ahead of us or in a different stage in their journey 
      to the point where their advice isn't as useful or straightforward. 
    </p>
    <p>
      While I am an ordinary guy, I've also had the opportunity to both be a part
      of incredible experiences and be around a lot of very successful and interesting 
      people over the years, and I've learned a ton from that as well.
